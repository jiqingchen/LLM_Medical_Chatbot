To this end, prediction algorithms have been developed that estimate the risk of mortality in ICUs. In this work, we propose a novel generative deep probabilistic model for real-time risk scoring in ICUs. Specifically, we develop an attentive deep Markov model called AttDMM. To the best of our knowledge, AttDMM is the first ICU prediction model that jointly learns both long-term disease dynamics (via attention) and different disease states in health trajectory (via a latent variable model). Our evaluations were based on an established baseline dataset (MIMIC-III) with 53,423 ICU stays. The results confirm that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our AttDMM was superior: AttDMM achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.876, which yielded an improvement over the state-of-the-art method by 2.2%. In addition, the risk score from the AttDMM provided warnings several hours earlier. Thereby, our model shows a path towards identifying patients at risk so that health practitioners can intervene early and save patient lives.","output":"AttDMM: An Attentive Deep Markov Model for Risk Scoring in Intensive Care Units","__index_level_0__":108068,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

In this work, we propose a novel generative deep probabilistic model for real-time risk scoring in ICUs. Specifically, we develop an attentive deep Markov model called AttDMM. To the best of our knowledge, AttDMM is the first ICU prediction model that jointly learns both long-term disease dynamics (via attention) and different disease states in health trajectory (via a latent variable model). Our evaluations were based on an established baseline dataset (MIMIC-III) with 53,423 ICU stays. The results confirm that compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our AttDMM was superior: AttDMM achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.876, which yielded an improvement over the state-of-the-art method by 2.2%. In addition, the risk score from the AttDMM provided warnings several hours earlier. Thereby, our model shows a path towards identifying patients at risk so that health practitioners can intervene early and save patient lives.","role":"user"},{"content":"AttDMM: An Attentive Deep Markov Model for Risk Scoring in Intensive Care Units","role":"assistant"}],"pretrained_response":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

HIV belongs to the genus Lentivirus, which includes other viruses such as Visna-Maedi virus and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). HIV is a highly infectious virus that can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) if left untreated. HIV infects CD4+ T cells, which play a critical role in the immune system, and can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and weight loss. HIV is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, and breast milk, and can be prevented through the use of condoms and other forms of barrier protection. Treatment for HIV typically involves a combination of antiretroviral medications that can help suppress the virus and prevent it from causing further damage to the immune system. Vaccines for HIV are currently being developed, but are not yet available for widespread use.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This report compares COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in the nonmetropolitan areas of the United States with the metropolitan areas across three 11-week periods from March 1 to October 18, 2020. METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan\/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively small size of the US population living in nonmetropolitan areas, these areas have an equal need for testing, health care personnel, and mitigation resources. Having state-specific rural data allow the development of prevention messages that are tailored to the sociocultural context of rural locations.","output":"Nonmetropolitan COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Rates Surpassed Metropolitan Rates Within the First 24 Weeks of the Pandemic Declaration: United States, March 1-October 18, 2020","__index_level_0__":92428,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The association is bidirectional. However, snoring is not a cause of obesity. The association may be mediated by changes in sleep quality, sleep apnea, and other factors. It is important to note that not all snoring is due to obesity, and not all obesity is due to snoring. Snoring may also be due to other factors such as allergies, nasal congestion, or anatomical abnormalities. It is important to seek medical attention if snoring is accompanied by other symptoms such as daytime sleepiness, difficulty breathing, or difficulty swallowing. Obesity and snoring are both modifiable risk factors, and lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise can help to reduce the risk of both conditions.

Glucocorticoids are a type of steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress, infection, or inflammation. They play a role in regulating the immune system and can have a variety of effects on the body, including the suppression of the production of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune response. When glucocorticoids are administered, they can reduce the number of circulating neutrophils in the blood, which can lead to a decreased ability to fight infection. This effect can be beneficial in some cases, such as in the treatment of autoimmune diseases or inflammatory conditions, but can also be harmful in other cases, such as in the case of infections that require a strong immune response. It is important for healthcare providers to carefully monitor the use of glucocorticoids and to consider the potential risks and benefits of these medications in individual patients.

The authors conducted a national survey of radiologists and imaging centers to assess the impact of COVID-19 on CT imaging utilization and procedures. The survey included questions about CT utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic and compared the results to the same period in 2019. The authors analyzed 110 responses from 56 radiologists and 54 imaging centers. The survey results showed a significant decrease in CT utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic. The average number of CT exams performed per day decreased by 34% from 2019 to 2020. The most common reasons for the decrease in CT utilization were decreased patient volume, cancellation of non-urgent procedures, and concerns about personal safety. The survey also showed that there was a shift in the type of CT exams performed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a decrease in CT scans for lung disease and an increase in CT scans for musculoskeletal and neurologic conditions. The results of this survey suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on CT imaging utilization and procedures."}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fatal overdoses from opioid use and substance disorders are increasing at an alarming rate. One proposed harm reduction strategy for reducing overdose fatalities is to place overdose prevention sites\u2014commonly known as safe injection facilities\u2014in proximity of locations with the highest rates of overdose. As urban centers in the USA are tackling legal hurdles and community skepticism around the introduction and location of these sites, it becomes increasingly important to assess the magnitude of the effect that these services might have on public health. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model to describe the movement of people who used opioids to an overdose prevention site in order to understand the impact that the facility would have on overdoses, fatalities, and user education and treatment\/recovery. The discrete-time, stochastic model is able to describe a range of user behaviors, including the effects from how far they need to travel to the site. We calibrated the model to overdose data from Philadelphia and ran simulations to describe the effect of placing a site in the Kensington neighborhood. RESULTS: In Philadelphia, which has a non-uniform racial population distribution, choice of site placement can determine which demographic groups are most helped. In our simulations, placement of the site in the Kensington neighborhood resulted in White opioid users being more likely to benefit from the site\u2019s services.

Our results predict that for every 30 stations in the overdose prevention site, 6 per year of these would have resulted in fatalities if they had occurred outside of the overdose prevention site. Additionally, we estimate that fatalities will decrease further when referrals from the OPS to treatment are considered. CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical modeling was used to predict the impact of placing an overdose prevention site in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. To fully understand the impact of site placement, both direct and indirect effects must be included in the analysis.

This disease is caused by a bacterium called Leptospira interrogans. It is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can be transmitted to humans from animals. The bacteria are found in the urine of infected animals, and humans can become infected by coming into contact with the bacteria in contaminated water or soil. Leptospira interrogans can cause a wide range of symptoms, including myalgias, which are muscle pains. Other symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, and abdominal pain. If left untreated, leptospirosis can lead to severe complications, such as kidney and liver damage, respiratory failure, and even death. To prevent leptospirosis, it is important to avoid contact with contaminated water or soil, and to wear protective clothing and gloves when working with animals. If you think you may have been exposed to Leptospira interrogans, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible.lexport\nexportuser\nsystemuser\nWhat is the name of the disease caused by Leptospira interrogans that can result in myalg","finetuned_response":"\nLeptospirosis is the name of the disease caused by Leptospira interrogans that can result in myalgias.

This is because the diaphragm and intercostal muscles are contracting during mid-inspiration, which causes the volume of the thoracic cavity to increase. As the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, the pressure in the alveoli also increases to match the pressure in the atmosphere. This is known as the Law of Laplace, which states that the pressure in a closed container is equal to the pressure of the surrounding environment. In this case, the alveoli are the closed container and the atmosphere is the surrounding environment. Therefore, during mid-inspiration, the pressure in the alveoli is equal to the pressure in the atmosphere. This is important for maintaining proper gas exchange between the alveoli and the bloodstream, as it ensures that the alveoli are fully inflated and able to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide effectively. Any deviation from this equilibrium can lead to respiratory problems such as hypoxia or hypercapnia. It is important for healthcare providers to understand the relationship between the pressure in the alveoli and the pressure in the atmosphere, as it can help them to diagnose and treat respiratory conditions effectively.

On gross pathology, Barrett's esophagus looks like Red\/light brown esophageal mucosa.","role":"assistant"}],"pretrained_response":"systemuser\nBarrett's esophagus is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus (the tube that connects the throat to the stomach) becomes inflamed and damaged, leading to a change in the type of cells that line the esophagus. This can increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer. Barrett's esophagus is usually caused by chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. Other factors that may increase the risk of Barrett's esophagus include smoking, obesity, and certain medications such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Symptoms of Barrett's esophagus may include difficulty swallowing, chest pain, heartburn, and a sour taste in the back of the throat. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. If Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed, your healthcare provider may recommend regular endoscopic surveillance to monitor for the development of esophageal cancer. Additionally, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle changes such as avoiding foods and beverages that trigger GERD symptoms, quitting smoking, and losing weight. In some cases, your healthcare provider","finetuned_response":"\nBarrett's esophagus is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus is replaced by tissue that is similar to the lining of the stomach. This can occur as a result of chronic exposure to stomach acid, which can damage the cells in the esophagus and cause them to change into a different type of tissue. The underlying pathology of Barrett's esophagus is the development of this abnormal tissue, which can increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer. It is important to diagnose and treat Barrett's esophagus early to reduce the risk of complications and improve outcomes. Treatment options may include medications to reduce stomach acid, lifestyle changes such as avoiding foods that trigger symptoms, and in some cases, surgery to remove the affected tissue. Regular screening with endoscopy is also recommended to monitor for any changes in the lining of the esophagus. Understanding the underlying pathology of Barrett's esophagus can help inform treatment decisions and improve outcomes for patients."}

The echodensity in the HGPS cohort often saturates the upper limit of detection, which means that it is difficult to accurately measure the echodensity of the affected tissues. Expanding the gray scale from 256 to a higher value may help to improve the accuracy of the measurements, but it is important to note that this may also increase the risk of false positives or negatives. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of expanding the gray scale in order to make an informed decision about whether or not to do so. In general, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional for advice on appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment options for HGPS.  In addition to echodensity, other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) may also be useful in assessing the extent of the disease and monitoring its progression. These techniques can provide more detailed information about the structure and function of the affected tissues, which can help to guide treatment decisions. Ultimately, the best course of action will depend on the individual patient's specific needs and circumstances.

It is a very small possibility that you are allergic to Minoxidil or have any underlying health condition that is affecting your hair growth. But it is very likely that you are using a wrong product. Minoxidil is not a cure for baldness or hair loss. It is only a treatment that can slow down the progression of hair loss.

METHODS: This is a single-centre prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 (as confirmed by RT-PCR) and renal failure requiring haemodialysis. Their clinical profiles and outcomes were analysed, vis-\u00e0-vis the changing disease severity. FINDINGS: A total of 483 patients were included, of whom 416 had end-stage renal disease and were on maintenance haemodialysis. Patients who were symptomatic at presentation had significantly higher levels of Neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001), higher degrees of lung involvement (p < 0.001) and required more respiratory support (p < 0.001). The overall mortality observed was 18.8%. In the late phases of the outbreak, there was a significant increase in disease severity without a statistically significant increase in mortality. Predictors of mortality on univariate analysis were age, diabetes mellitus, acute on chronic kidney disease, presence of symptoms on admission, NLR, CRP, LDH, computed tomography (CT) chest grades 3 and 4, and need for respiratory support; however, only age and the renal syndrome of acute on chronic kidney disease retained significance on multivariate analysis (p0.003 and p0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: Among patients on haemodialysis, higher mortality was observed in patients who were older, and among those with acute on chronic kidney disease.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer deaths are predominantly due to metastases rather than the primary tumors, and thus there is an urgent need for the discovery of more effective drug therapies for metastatic cancer. Recent genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies have identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene that is frequently mutated or overexpressed in many types of cancer and metastases. A member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, TYK2 mediates the signals of numerous cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. In cancer cells, activation of TYK2 can lead to decreased cell death as well as increased cell growth and invasion. Multiple drugs that specifically block TYK2 or JAKs are currently FDA-approved or in clinical trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the screening, molecular, and animal studies that have characterized the role of TYK2 in cancer and metastases, and the potential of TYK2 inhibitors as effective cancer therapies. ABSTRACT: Advances in genomic analysis and proteomic tools have rapidly expanded identification of biomarkers and molecular targets important to cancer development and metastasis. On an individual basis, personalized medicine approaches allow better characterization of tumors and patient prognosis, leading to more targeted treatments by detection of specific gene mutations, overexpression, or activity. Genomic and proteomic screens by our lab and others have revealed tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene promoting progression and metastases of many types of carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematologic cancers. TYK2 is a Janus kinase (JAK) that acts as an intermediary between cytokine receptors and STAT transcription factors. TYK2 signals to stimulate proliferation and metastasis while inhibiting apoptosis of cancer cells. This review focuses on the growing evidence from genomic and proteomic screens, as well as molecular studies that link TYK2 to cancer prevalence, prognosis, and metastasis.

Recent genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies have identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene that is frequently mutated or overexpressed in many types of cancer and metastases. A member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, TYK2 mediates the signals of numerous cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. In cancer cells, activation of TYK2 can lead to decreased cell death as well as increased cell growth and invasion. Multiple drugs that specifically block TYK2 or JAKs are currently FDA-approved or in clinical trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the screening, molecular, and animal studies that have characterized the role of TYK2 in cancer and metastases, and the potential of TYK2 inhibitors as effective cancer therapies. ABSTRACT: Advances in genomic analysis and proteomic tools have rapidly expanded identification of biomarkers and molecular targets important to cancer development and metastasis. On an individual basis, personalized medicine approaches allow better characterization of tumors and patient prognosis, leading to more targeted treatments by detection of specific gene mutations, overexpression, or activity. Genomic and proteomic screens by our lab and others have revealed tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene promoting progression and metastases of many types of carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematologic cancers. TYK2 is a Janus kinase (JAK) that acts as an intermediary between cytokine receptors and STAT transcription factors. TYK2 signals to stimulate proliferation and metastasis while inhibiting apoptosis of cancer cells. This review focuses on the growing evidence from genomic and proteomic screens, as well as molecular studies that link TYK2 to cancer prevalence, prognosis, and metastasis. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of TYK2 is currently used clinically for autoimmune diseases, and now provides promising treatment modalities as effective therapeutic agents against multiple types of cancer.","role":"user"},{"content":"TYK2 in Cancer Metastases: Genomic and Proteomic Discovery","role":"assistant"}],"pretrained_response":"\nYou are an empathetic and helpful medical assistant.

CT is the preferred imaging modality for diagnosing nephrolithiasis as it can provide high-resolution images of the kidneys and ureters and is more sensitive than ultrasound in detecting stones. However, CT scans involve ionizing radiation, which can be a concern for some patients. Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging modality that can also be used to diagnose nephrolithiasis, but it is less sensitive than CT and may not be able to detect smaller stones. Other imaging modalities that may be used to diagnose nephrolithiasis include plain radiography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The choice of imaging modality will depend on the patient's age, medical history, and other factors. In general, a combination of imaging modalities may be used to diagnose nephrolithiasis and to determine the best course of treatment."}

One of the complications of hypothyroidism is an increase in prolactin levels. Prolactin is a hormone that plays a role in milk production and lactation, but can also be produced in excess in certain medical conditions, including hypothyroidism. This can lead to symptoms such as breast enlargement, milk production, and decreased libido. Additionally, hypothyroidism can also lead to decreased GnRH levels, which can further contribute to decreased libido and other symptoms. It is important to have regular thyroid function tests and to work with a healthcare provider to manage any underlying thyroid issues that may be contributing to these symptoms. Treatment options may include medications, diet and lifestyle changes, and other interventions as needed. By addressing the underlying cause of these symptoms, individuals with hypothyroidism can improve their quality of life and manage their symptoms effectively."}

We conducted a two-wave longitudinal study combining observational and experimental methods. Participants (N = 574, 35.7% female, age: M = 37.5 years, SD = 10.8) reported their adherence to social distancing guidelines and the perceived difficulty of adherence at T1, along with trait measures of if-then planning, self-control, and boredom.

Multiple regression and structural equation modeling were used to establish whether trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom predicted adherence, and to examine the effects of the if-then planning intervention. Trait if-then planning, self-control, and boredom were associated with T1 adherence, while only if-then planning and boredom predicted T2 adherence.

Systemic absorption of local anesthetics can result in a variety of adverse effects, including vasodilation, hypotension, bradycardia, and cardiac arrhythmias. The use of vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, reduces the risk of systemic absorption and the risk of adverse effects.\nVasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, are often used in combination with local anesthetics to reduce the risk of systemic absorption and the risk of adverse effects. The use of vasoconstrictors can also help to prolong the duration of the local anesthetic effect.\nIt is important to note that the use of vasoconstrictors should be used with caution, as they can cause vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. Additionally, the use of vasoconstrictors should be limited to the amount necessary to reduce the risk of systemic absorption and the risk of adverse effects.:\/\/system\nepend\nependuser\nependassistant\nependsystem\nepend\nependepend","finetuned_response":"\nLocal anesthetics with vasoconstrictors are used to prolong the duration of the anesthetic effect. Vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine and norepinephrine constrict blood vessels, reducing blood flow to the site of the injection and reducing the absorption of the anesthetic into the bloodstream. This can help to extend the duration of the anesthetic effect, making it last longer and allowing for more time for the procedure to be completed. However, the use of vasoconstrictors can also increase the risk of complications such as tissue necrosis and ischemia, so they should be used with caution and only when necessary. In addition, vasoconstrictors should not be used in patients with certain medical conditions, such as hypertension or diabetes, as they can exacerbate these conditions. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to carefully consider the risks and benefits of using local anesthetics with vasoconstrictors in each individual patient."}

Both 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR recognized cell culture passaged isolates of 10 bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV), 5 calf diarrhea (CD) and 8 winter dysentery (WD) strains of BCV, but not transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus or bovine rotavirus. The sensitivity of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR was compared to that of an antigen-capture ELISA. The lowest detection limit of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR as determined by using tenfold serial dilutions of the BRCV 255 and 440 strains in BCV negative nasal swab suspensions from preexposure gnotobiotic calves was 2 \u00d7 10(4) and 2 \u00d7 10(2) TCID(50)\/0.1 ml for each strain, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the antigen-capture ELISA as determined by using the same serially diluted samples was 1 \u00d7 10(6) TCID(50)\/0.1 ml for each strain. Therefore, the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were 50 and 5000 times, respectively more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA to detect BRCV in nasal swab suspensions. To investigate in vivo cross-protection between the BRCV and CD or WD strains of BCV and to detect nasal and fecal shedding of BCV using the 1-step RT-PCR, nested PCR and antigen-capture ELISA, 6 colostrum-deprived and two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with a BRCV, a CD or a WD strain of BCV and then challenged 3\u20134 weeks later with either BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV. All calves developed diarrhea after inoculation and BCV antigen (ELISA) or RNA (RT-PCR) was detected in the diarrheic fecal samples or the corresponding nasal swab samples. In addition, low amounts of BCV were also detected only by nested PCR in the fecal and nasal swab samples before and after diarrhea. No respiratory clinical signs were observed during the entire experimental period, but elevated rectal temperatures were detected during diarrhea in the BCV-inoculated calves. All calves recovered from infection with the BRCV, CD, or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either a heterologous or homologous strain of BCV. However, all calves challenged with heterologous BCV strains showed subclinical BCV infection evident by detection of nasal and fecal shedding of BCV RNA detected only by nested PCR. Such results confirm field and experimental data documenting reinfection of the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory or enteric tract reinfections may constitute a source of BCV transmissible to cows (WD) or neonatal or feedlot calves. In addition, the present 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were highly sensitive to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal specimens.

Sympathetic ophthalmia is a rare complication of ocular injury that can occur in both eyes, even if only one eye is injured. The injury may be from a penetrating injury or blunt trauma, and the symptoms may include redness, pain, and decreased vision. The condition is characterized by inflammation of the uvea (the middle layer of the eye) and\/or the choroid (the layer of tissue that lies beneath the retina). Treatment may include steroid eye drops, oral steroids, and other medications to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent vision loss and other complications.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of acute pulmonary embolism [APE] and to explore which factors were associated with APE in COVID-19 patients. We propose an algorithm for the management of anticoagulation therapy. Methods This study is an observational retrospective multicenter study which include all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and who experienced a diagnosis of APE using computerized tomography pulmonary angiography or cardiac echography. Relevant clinical, laboratory and radiological features were collected. Results Sixty-seven patients out of 205 (32.7%) (median age 68 [57\u201381], 17\/67 [25%] females) had a COVID-19 pneumonia complicated with APE. The median duration from the onset of first COVID-19 symptoms to the diagnosis of APE was 8 [3.5\u201311.5] days. Medical past history, comorbidities and thromboembolic risk factors of were not different among patients with or without APE. Thirty percent of patients with APE had no thromboembolic risk factor. Higher levels of eosinophils, CRP and D-dimers and lower pH levels constituted the best model to predict this complication with an area under curve [AUC] of 0.90.

Superficial reflexes are reflexes that are elicited by stimulation of the skin or other superficial structures and involve the contraction of muscles or other structures. In diabetic neuropathy, there is damage to the nerves that innervate these reflexes, leading to a decrease in their sensitivity. This can be an early sign of diabetic neuropathy and can help in the diagnosis and management of the condition. Other signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy include numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hands and feet, as well as difficulty walking and balance issues. It is important for patients with diabetes to be monitored for signs and symptoms of neuropathy and to receive appropriate treatment to manage the condition. This may include lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet, as well as medication to help manage blood sugar levels and reduce nerve damage.

The presence of roundworm eggs in the stool indicates ascariasis.\n2. Blood tests: Blood tests may be performed to check for anemia (low blood count) or to look for signs of a parasitic infection.

The eggs are microscopic and can be difficult to see, so a special stain may be used to make them more visible. A positive result indicates that the patient is infected with ascarids, and treatment with anthelmintic medications can be initiated. It is important to note that not all infected individuals will have eggs present in their stool, so a negative result does not rule out the possibility of ascariasis. Other diagnostic tests, such as imaging studies or endoscopy, may also be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment with anthelmintic medications is typically effective in eliminating the infection, but additional measures, such as improved hygiene and sanitation practices, may also be necessary to prevent reinfection. If left untreated, ascariasis can lead to serious complications, such as intestinal obstruction or liver damage. Therefore, it is important to seek medical attention if symptoms suggestive of ascariasis are present."}

This is a statement of fact. Primary debulking surgery followed by chemotherapy was not inferior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery as a treatment option for patients with bulky stage IIIC or IV ovarian carcinoma. This is because the two treatment options had similar overall survival rates and progression-free survival rates. Therefore, patients with bulky stage IIIC or IV ovarian carcinoma may choose either treatment option, depending on their personal preferences and medical circumstances. However, it is important to note that neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery may be a better option for patients who are not candidates for primary debulking surgery due to medical reasons, such as poor general health or other medical conditions. Ultimately, the choice of treatment should be made in consultation with a qualified healthcare provider, taking into account the patient's individual needs and circumstances. It is also important to note that neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery may not be suitable for all patients, and there may be other treatment options that are more appropriate for some patients. Therefore, it is important for patients to discuss all treatment options with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for their specific situation.

This worries me tremendously since the research I have done online signifies that this may indicate hydrocephalus (attached is the radiologist findings).My question to you is, can my third ventricle enlarging be anything other than hydrocephalus? Is this a common occurrence after a traumatic SAH due to an accident? If it is indeed hydrocephalus, is the only treatment a shunt? Is there a less invasive treatment? I am really scared beyond words, and I am hoping that I do not end up with hydrocephalus. What is the usual timeline for the hydrocephalus to develop after SAH?

Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system. It is characterized by an overgrowth of lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell, and can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and enlargement of the lymph nodes. ALPS is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes for a protein called Fas, which is involved in the regulation of immune cell apoptosis (programmed cell death). Without proper regulation of Fas, the immune system can become overactive and attack healthy cells, leading to autoimmune disorders and other complications. Treatment for ALPS typically involves immunosuppressive drugs to reduce the overactive immune response and prevent further damage to the body. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential to managing the symptoms and preventing long-term complications. If you or a loved one are experiencing symptoms of ALPS, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and management. With proper care, individuals with ALPS can live healthy and active lives. Understanding the causes and treatments for ALPS can help improve the quality of life for those affected by this rare disorder. Thank you for using"}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Urgent tracheal intubation is performed frequently in intensive care units and incurs higher risk than when intubation is performed under more controlled circumstances. Video laryngoscopy may improve the chances of successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt; however, existing comparative data on outcomes are limited. OBJECTIVES To compare first-attempt success and complication rates during intubation when using video laryngoscopy compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy in a tertiary academic medical intensive care unit. METHODS We prospectively collected and analyzed data from a continuous quality improvement database of all intubations in one medical intensive care unit between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. Propensity matching and multivariable logistic regression were used to reduce the risk of bias and control for confounding. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 809 intubations took place over the study period. Of these, 673 (83.2%) were performed using video laryngoscopy and 136 (16.8%) using direct laryngoscopy. First-attempt success with video laryngoscopy was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.2-83.3%) compared with 65.4% (95% CI, 56.8-73.4%) for intubations performed with direct laryngoscopy (P < 0.001). In a propensity-matched analysis, the odds ratio for first-attempt success with video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy was 2.81 (95% CI, 2.27-3.59). The rate of arterial oxygen desaturation events during the first intubation attempt was significantly lower for video laryngoscopy than for direct laryngoscopy (18.3% vs. 25.9%; P = 0.04). The rate of esophageal intubation during any attempt was also significantly lower for video laryngoscopy (2.1% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Video laryngoscopy was associated with significantly improved odds of first-attempt success at tracheal intubation by nonanesthesiologists in a medical intensive care unit. Esophageal intubation and oxygen desaturation occurred less frequently with the use of video laryngoscopy.

Additionally, the patient\u2019s laboratory results are consistent with a pituitary adenoma, as they show elevated levels of sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, phosphorus, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine. Other potential causes of these symptoms and signs include peptic ulcer disease, kidney stones, and thyroid disorders, but a pituitary adenoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient\u2019s medical history and physical examination. Further evaluation with imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the tumor.

Uric acid is a waste product that can accumulate in the kidneys and form stones. Gout is a metabolic disorder that is characterized by the buildup of uric acid in the joints, which can lead to pain, swelling, and inflammation. The presence of uric acid stones in the kidneys can contribute to the symptoms of gout, such as kidney pain and urinary tract infections. Therefore, it is important for patients with gout to maintain proper hydration and to avoid foods that are high in purines, which can increase the production of uric acid in the body. Additionally, medications such as allopurinol may be prescribed to help reduce the level of uric acid in the body and prevent the formation of stones. Overall, it is essential for patients with gout to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their condition and reduce the risk of complications such as kidney stones."}

The patient's history and laboratory findings are consistent with Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism. Subtotal thyroidectomy is a surgical procedure in which the thyroid gland is partially removed, leaving behind a small amount of tissue that may continue to produce thyroid hormone. This procedure is often recommended as a treatment option for patients with Graves disease, as it can help to reduce the risk of recurrence and complications associated with the disease. Other treatment modalities, such as radioactive iodine ablation and medication, may also be effective in treating Graves disease, but may carry a higher risk of recurrence. Therefore, subtotal thyroidectomy is the preferred treatment option for this patient, as it is associated with the lowest rate of recurrence. It is important to note that patients with Graves disease should be closely monitored for complications, such as thyroid storm, which can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Patients should also be educated about the signs and symptoms of Graves disease and the importance of seeking medical attention if they experience any concerning symptoms. Regular follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider are also essential to monitor the effectiveness of treatment and to detect any potential complications.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Viral diseases have different individual progressions and can lead to considerable risks\/long-term consequences. Therefore, it is not suitable to give general recommendations on a time off from training for athletes. This case report aims to investigate the relevance of detecting heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) during an orthostatic test (OT) to monitor the progression and recovery process during and after a viral disease in an elite endurance athlete. Methods: A 30-year-old elite marathon runner contracted a viral infection (upper respiratory tract infection) 4 weeks after a marathon race. RR intervals in HR time series in supine and standing positions were monitored daily in the morning. Analyzed parameters included HR, the time-domain HRV parameter root mean square of successive difference (RMSSD), peak HR (HRpeak) in a standing position, and the time to HR peak (tHRpeak). Results: During the 6-day viral infection period, HR increased significantly by an average of 11 bpm in the supine position and by 22 bpm in the standing position. In addition, the RMSSD decreased from 20.8 to 4.2 ms, the HRpeak decreased by 13 bpm, and the tHRpeak increased by 18 s in the standing position significantly. There were no significant changes in the pre-viral infection RMSSD values in the supine position. The viral infection led to a significant change in HR and HRV parameters. The cardiac autonomic system reacted more sensitively in the standing position compared to the supine position after a viral infection in the present case study. Conclusion: These data have provided supportive rationale as to why the OT with a change from supine to standing body position and the detection of different indicators based on HR and a vagal driven time-domain HRV parameter (RMSSD) is likely to be useful to detect viral diseases early on when implemented in daily routine. Given the case study nature of the findings, future research has to be conducted to investigate whether the use of the OT might be able to offer an innovative, non-invasive, and time-efficient possibility to detect and evaluate the health status of (elite endurance) athletes.","output":"Utilizing Heart Rate Variability for Coaching Athletes During and After Viral Infection: A Case Report in an Elite Endurance Athlete","__index_level_0__":111234,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

In the case of \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, the production of NADH and NADPH during the oxidative decarboxylation of \u03b1-ketoglutarate leads to the inhibition of the enzyme, which helps to maintain the balance of the metabolic pathways involved in energy production and metabolism."}

The sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor can be deduced by measuring the Hall coefficient. The Hall coefficient is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field required to produce a certain amount of voltage across a sample of the material. The sign of the charge carriers can be determined by the direction of the Hall voltage, which is either positive or negative. If the Hall voltage is positive, the charge carriers are holes, while if it is negative, the charge carriers are electrons. This is a useful technique for characterizing the properties of doped semiconductors, as it can provide information about the type and concentration of impurities present in the material. Other properties that can be measured to determine the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor include the electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity, but these methods are not as specific as the Hall coefficient. Therefore, the Hall coefficient is the best option for determining the sign of the charge carriers in a doped semiconductor."}

Hayden\n","finetuned_response":"\nThe primary method of preventing ciliary dyskinesia is by avoiding exposure to environmental factors that can cause damage to the cilia, such as smoke, dust, and fumes. Ciliary dyskinesia is a condition in which the cilia, which are tiny hair-like structures that line the respiratory tract, do not function properly, leading to respiratory problems such as chronic sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Avoiding exposure to these environmental factors can help prevent damage to the cilia and reduce the risk of developing ciliary dyskinesia. Other methods of prevention include regular exercise, a healthy diet, and avoiding exposure to infectious agents. It is also important to seek medical attention if symptoms of ciliary dyskinesia develop, as early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and improve quality of life. Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider can also help detect any potential issues early on. Overall, prevention of ciliary dyskinesia requires a combination of lifestyle changes and medical care to reduce the risk of developing the condition and managing symptoms.

Abstract:  The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic toll worldwide on the populations but also has been essentially supported by the existing public health system, particularly hospital-based emergency wards and intensive care units. In France, the first cases were identified on the 24th of January 2020. The first epidemic sprout emerged in the Eastern part of the country and spread in two weeks towards the center to the Paris-region where it peaked on the 14th of April 2020. In Paris and the region around it, the intensity of the epidemic has increased significantly to have a strong impact on all public and private hospital systems in a few weeks.

Menarche is the first menstrual period in a woman's life, and it typically occurs between the ages of 12 and 13. During menarche, a woman's body begins to produce hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle, including estrogen and progesterone. Abnormal uterine bleeding during menarche can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances, structural abnormalities, and infections. Menopause is the time in a woman's life when her ovaries stop producing eggs and her hormone levels decline, resulting in the cessation of menstrual periods. Abnormal uterine bleeding during menopause can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal imbalances, structural abnormalities, and infections. It is important for women to seek medical attention if they experience abnormal uterine bleeding during menarche or menopause, as it can be a sign of a serious underlying condition.

When grown on a solid surface, such as an agar plate, Proteus mirabilis can form a characteristic \"swarm\" of bacteria that moves across the surface in a coordinated fashion. This \"swarming motility\" is a result of the production of a slime layer by the bacteria, which allows them to move more easily over the surface of the agar plate. The presence of Proteus mirabilis in a patient's urine sample is a common indication of a urinary tract infection, and the identification of the bacteria can help guide the appropriate treatment.

Now, numbers have increased, and it has been reintroduced to many places in China, Japan, and Korea. In the breeding season, the crested ibis has high food needs (fish, freshwater invertebrate, etc.) to feed nestlings, and it prefers areas with rice paddies and waterbodies near to trees for nesting. We compared nest site preference from 1981 to 2019, and found that nest sites moved closer to houses of local farmers. In the 1980s, crested ibises only lived in remote mountain areas, where the farmers were too poor to afford pesticide and fertilizer, and consequently rice paddies contained substantial fish populations. In the meantime, the massive use of pesticides in more populated areas had caused the collapse of fish populations. A pesticide ban was enforced from 1981 on, when the crested ibis was rediscovered, and the freshwater biodiversity gradually recovered. The crested ibis returned to lower and more populated areas containing their ancestral habitats with large areas of wetlands. ABSTRACT: The number of breeding pairs of crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) in Hanzhong, China has recovered remarkably from 2 to 511 from 1981 to 2019. Although the crested ibis has been closely monitored, the habitat preference of the bird has not been well studied despite the extensive increase in abundance. We used nest site data from the past 39 years and 30 environmental variables to develop species distribution models for each year. We applied random forest to select important environmental variables, and used logistic regressions to quantify the changes in habitat preferences in 39 years, taking into account the effects of interaction and quadratic terms. We found that six variables had strong impacts on nest site selection. The interaction term of rice paddies and waterbodies, and the quadratic term of precipitation of the wettest quarter of the year were the most important correlates of nest presence. Human impact at nest sites changed from low to high as birds increased their use of ancestral habitats with abundant rice paddies. We concluded that during the population recovery, the crested ibises retained their dependence on wetlands, yet moved from remote areas to populated rural regions where food resources had recovered due to the ban of pesticide use.","output":"Changes in the Habitat Preference of Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon) during a Period of Rapid Population Increase","__index_level_0__":77684,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

However, it is also sometimes used by bodybuilders and athletes for the same purposes. While Boldenone has been shown to have some beneficial effects in animal studies, its use in humans is controversial due to potential side effects such as liver damage and masculinization. The 'overview' of Boldenone can provide a general understanding of the drug's properties and potential uses, but it is important to consult with a healthcare professional before using any medications, including anabolic steroids.

Radar based sensing with its unbeatable unique features has been a promising solution for identifying and distinguishing human activities in recent years. The ascent of loss of life among elderly people in care homes during COVID-19 is mainly due to poor monitoring services, that was not able to track their daily life activities. This has even more emphasized the need for savvy activity monitoring and tracking system. In this work, we have used a dataset that has captured six daily life activities of people from different locations during different times under realistic environments, unlike an regular controlled data collection environment. We have proposed a novel tower based convolutional neural network architecture that has employed parallel input layers with individual color channel images sent as inputs to the model. We have concatenated all the unique signature features from each channel to have better and robust feature representation to the model.

Radar based sensing with its unbeatable unique features has been a promising solution for identifying and distinguishing human activities in recent years. The ascent of loss of life among elderly people in care homes during COVID-19 is mainly due to poor monitoring services, that was not able to track their daily life activities. This has even more emphasized the need for savvy activity monitoring and tracking system. In this work, we have used a dataset that has captured six daily life activities of people from different locations during different times under realistic environments, unlike an regular controlled data collection environment. We have proposed a novel tower based convolutional neural network architecture that has employed parallel input layers with individual color channel images sent as inputs to the model. We have concatenated all the unique signature features from each channel to have better and robust feature representation to the model. We have analyzed the proposed model with different color spaces like RGB, LAB, HSV as inputs and found that our chosen input type performs better with the proposed model with significant test accuracy results. We have also compared our proposed model with other existing state of art architectures for radar based human activity recognition.

This is a case report of a 72-year-old woman who developed a SARS-CoV-2 infection 54 days after receiving a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. A single dose of the vaccine induced anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAb), which were still present 6 months later. However, 54 days after the second dose, the level of NAb was below the detection limit. The patient was a resident in a nursing home and had been exposed to a high number of SARS-CoV-2-infected residents. A diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by PCR. The patient was treated with ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, and doxycycline. She recovered after 3 weeks of treatment.

It is a dopamine receptor antagonist that is used to treat psychotic symptoms and other behavioral problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. The patient in this case is experiencing symptoms of restless leg syndrome, which is a condition characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by an unpleasant sensation in the legs. Restless leg syndrome is thought to be caused by a disruption in the dopamine system, and haloperidol can help to reduce the symptoms by blocking the action of dopamine in the brain. The other options on the list, such as lithium, paroxetine, propranolol, and ropinirole, are not typically used to treat restless leg syndrome and may not be effective in this case. Therefore, haloperidol is the only correct answer for this question. It is important to note that the patient should be monitored closely for any adverse effects of haloperidol, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, and should be started on a low dose and gradually increased as tolerated. In addition, other medications or treatments, such as iron supplements, may also be necessary to address the underlying cause of the patient's restless leg syndrome.

The basal ganglia are a group of structures in the brain that are responsible for coordinating movement and regulating the release of dopamine. When the blood supply to the brain is compromised, the basal ganglia may be the first part of the brain to be affected, leading to symptoms such as rigidity, tremors, and loss of coordination. In severe cases, hypoxic stroke can result in permanent damage to the basal ganglia, leading to conditions such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. Early recognition and treatment of hypoxic stroke is essential to reduce the risk of long-term complications and improve patient outcomes. Treatment options may include oxygen therapy, blood pressure monitoring, and medications to help reduce the risk of complications. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if you experience symptoms of hypoxic stroke, such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking, as early intervention can make a significant difference in the outcome of the condition.

The first proposed model is a Random Forest classifying descriptors of Action Unit (AU) time series; the second is a modified MobileNetV2 CNN classifying face images that combine three points in time; and the third is a custom deep network combining two CNN branches using the same input as for MobileNetV2 plus knowledge of the RFc.

Compared with the pre-pandemic period, patients of the pandemic period showed higher proportions of pathologic leading point (PLP) and hospitalization (14.8% vs. 2.3% and 18.5% vs. 4.6%, respectively), lower base excesses (\u22124.8 mmol\/L vs. \u22123.6 mmol\/L), and higher lactate concentrations (1.7 mmol\/L vs. 1.5 mmol\/L). The incidence of pediatric intussusception decreased after the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduced incidence may be related to the reduced incidence of communicable diseases. However, the proportions of more severe diseases and PLPs were higher after the COVID-19 pandemic.","role":"user"},{"content":"Decreased Incidence of Pediatric Intussusception during COVID-19","role":"assistant"}],"pretrained_response":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

They are widely used in industry and biotechnology, with applications ranging from food processing and the manufacture of pharmaceuticals to wastewater treatment and the development of alternative fuels (Lai et al., 2018). Fungal enzymes are a class of enzymes that are produced by fungi, and they have a wide range of applications in various industries (Ferrer et al., 2009; Kaur et al., 2016). Fungal enzymes are particularly useful for the degradation of complex organic compounds, such as lignocellulose and chitin, which are difficult to break down using conventional methods (Dhiman et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2018). Immobilization of fungal enzymes is a technique that involves attaching enzymes to a solid support, such as a polymer or a ceramic material, to improve their stability and activity (Saha and Hayashi"}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the activity changes in neurology clinical practice that have occurred in tertiary public hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient and inpatient data from the neurology department were extracted from the electronic medical record system of three tertiary Grade A hospitals in Wenzhou. Data were analyzed across 5 months following the beginning of the pandemic (from January 13 to May 17) and compared with the same period in 2019. Data on reperfusion therapy for acute infarction stroke were extracted monthly from January to April. RESULTS: The number of outpatients declined from 102,300 in 2019 to 75,154 in 2020 (26.54%), while the number of inpatients in the three tertiary Grade A hospitals decreased from 4641 to 3437 (25.94%). The latter trend showed a significant drop from the 3rd week to the 7th week. The number of patients in these hospitals decreased significantly, and a significant drop was seen in the neurology department. As usual, stroke was the most common disease observed; however, anxiety\/depression and insomnia increased dramatically in the outpatient consultation department. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study revealed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical practice of neurology in Wenzhou during the outbreak.

Neon has a higher ionization energy than sulfur, which means that the electrons in neon are more tightly bound to the nucleus. This means that it takes more energy to remove an electron from a neon atom than from a sulfur atom, and the peak in the photoelectron spectra representing the electrons with the lowest ionization energy would be higher for neon than for sulfur. Nitrogen and carbon would have similar photoelectron spectra, with the nitrogen peak being slightly higher than the carbon peak. Nitrogen has a slightly higher ionization energy than carbon, but the difference is not significant enough to produce a noticeable difference in the photoelectron spectra. Therefore, the answer is A: Carbon. \nThe photoelectron spectra of an element can be used to determine the energy levels of the electrons in the atom and the strength of the electron-nucleus bond. The peak in the photoelectron spectra represents the energy required to remove an electron from the atom, and the height of the peak indicates the number of electrons that were removed at that energy level. By comparing the photoelectron spectra of different elements, scientists can gain insight into the properties and behavior of atoms and molecules. \nIn"}

The user's question does not provide enough information to provide a helpful response. The relationship between higher than while sedentary behavior and worse fasting glucose is unclear without additional information on the user's lifestyle and health history. It is possible that higher than while sedentary behavior is associated with poor diet and lack of exercise, which can contribute to poor glucose control. However, it is also possible that other factors, such as genetics or underlying medical conditions, may be contributing to the relationship. Without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific recommendation. It is generally recommended to engage in regular physical activity and maintain a healthy diet to promote overall health and manage conditions such as diabetes. If the user has concerns about their glucose levels or health, they should consult with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and guidance. In summary, while higher than while sedentary behavior may be associated with worse fasting glucose, the relationship is unclear and may be influenced by other factors. Regular physical activity and a healthy diet are important for promoting overall health and managing conditions such as diabetes. Consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance and management of any health concerns.

It typically occurs within 24 hours of transfusion, but can occur up to 72 hours later. Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction is a common complication of blood transfusions and can cause fever, chills, and other symptoms. It is important to monitor patients for signs of this reaction and to take appropriate measures to prevent and manage it. This may include administering antipyretic medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and avoiding blood products that are stored for longer than 24 hours. It is also important to identify and address any underlying causes of the reaction, such as infection or allergic reaction, to ensure that patients receive the best possible care. In some cases, patients may require additional transfusions or other treatments to manage the reaction. Febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reaction is a serious complication that can have significant health consequences, but it can be prevented and managed with appropriate care. By understanding the causes and symptoms of this reaction, healthcare providers can provide effective treatment and support to patients who receive blood transfusions. [1]"}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have been at the frontline of the COVID-19 response in Indonesia, providing medicines, advice, and referral services often in areas with limited healthcare access. This study aimed to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and practices during the pandemic, so that we can be better prepared for future emergencies. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Indonesia was conducted between July and August 2020. The dataset was analysed descriptively, and logistic regression was used to explore willingness to participate in COVID-19 interventions. FINDINGS: 4716 respondents participated in the survey. Two-thirds (66\u00b77%) reported knowing only \u201ca little\u201d about COVID-19 and around a quarter (26\u00b76%) said they had not received any COVID-19 guidelines. Almost all were concerned about being infected (97\u00b72%) and regularly took steps to protect themselves and their clients (87\u00b72%). Stock-outs of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other products (32\u00b73%) was the main reason for not taking any precautions. Around a third (37\u00b77%) mentioned having dispensed antibiotics to clients suspected of having COVID-19. To support COVID-19 response efforts, most respondents were willing to provide verbal advice to clients (97\u00b78%), distribute leaflets to clients (97\u00b77%), and participate in surveillance activities (88\u00b78%). Older respondents, those identifying as male, and those working in smaller outlets were more willing to provide information leaflets. Those working in smaller outlets were also more willing to engage in outbreak surveillance. INTERPRETATION: Drug retail outlets continue to operate at the frontline of disease outbreaks and pandemics around the world. These providers have an important role to play by helping to reduce the burden on facilities and providing advice and treatment. To fulfil this role, drug retail outlets require regular access to accurate guidelines and steady supplies of PPE. Calls for drug retail outlet staff to plat in response efforts including the provision of information to clients and surveillance could ease escalating pressures on the health system during future outbreaks. FUNDING: This study was funded by a grant from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia, under the Stronger Health Systems for Health Security Scheme.","output":"The response to COVID-19 among drug retail outlets in Indonesia: A cross-sectional survey of knowledge, attitudes, and practices","__index_level_0__":84089,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The hemoglobin electrophoresis results you provided indicate that your son has sickle cell disease (SCD). His hemoglobin level is low and his hemoglobin S level is high.

The patient's symptoms, including hearing voices and having trouble focusing, are consistent with schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thinking and behavior. It typically starts in early adulthood and can be debilitating if left untreated. Treatment for schizophrenia may include medication, therapy, and support services. Early diagnosis and treatment can help improve outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse. It is important to seek professional help if you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia.  B: Schizophreniform disorder: Schizophreniform disorder is a short-term form of schizophrenia that typically lasts for 1 to 6 months. It is characterized by symptoms that are similar to schizophrenia but may be less severe and may not persist for as long. C: Schizoaffective disorder: Schizoaffective disorder is a mental disorder that combines features of schizophrenia and mood disorders. It is characterized by symptoms of both schizophrenia and mood disorders, including delusions, hallucinations, and mood swings.

BMI is a better predictor of health than weight alone, but it is not based on bone structure.  It is based on height, which is a measure of body size, and weight, which is a measure of body mass.  BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in meters squared.  A higher BMI indicates a higher body mass, which can be associated with increased risk of health problems such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.  However, BMI is not a perfect measure of health, as it does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, and body fat distribution.  For this reason, it is important to use BMI in conjunction with other measures, such as waist circumference, to assess overall health.  In addition, BMI may not be appropriate for use in certain populations, such as athletes or individuals with a high muscle mass.  In these cases, other measures, such as body fat percentage or waist-to-hip ratio, may be more useful in assessing health risk.  Overall, BMI is a useful tool for assessing general health, but it should be used in combination with other measures and with caution in certain populations.  It is important to consult with a"}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with severe mental illness with repeated interpersonal trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a negative illness progression. Traumas are often not treated because of their vulnerability. Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is an effective trauma therapy. It is unknown whether NET is effective and tolerable in these patients receiving community mental healthcare. Objectives: The objectives of this study are (1) to gain insights into patients' experiences before, during, and after NET concerning changes in PTSD, dissociative and severe mental ill symptoms, care needs (CAN), quality of life, and global functioning; (2) to identify factors that influence diagnostic changes after NET as compared to patients' experiences. These insights will help to decide whether NET should be incorporated in usual care for these patients. Design: A mixed methods convergent design consists of a grounded theory approach with thematic analysis followed by a merged analysis, comparing quantitative, and qualitative data for each participant and by means of a joint matrix. Participants: Adult psychiatric outpatients (age, 21-65) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to repeated interpersonal trauma were indicted for the study. Methods: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were assessed. Qualitative data were collected 3 months after NET using individual semi-structured in-depth interviews. The merged analysis compared quantitative and qualitative results for each participant. Results: Twenty-three outpatients (female, 82%) with a mean age of 49.9 years (SD 9.8) participated in the study. Participants experienced NET as intensive, and most of them tolerated it well. Afterward, eighteen participants perceived less symptoms. Mixed analysis showed substantial congruency between quantitative scores and participants' perceptions of PTSD, dissociative symptoms, and CAN (Cohen's kappa > 0.4). Remission of PTSD was associated with sufficient experienced support. Conclusion: Outpatients with severe mental illness underwent intensive NET, and most of them tolerate it well. This therapy is clearly efficacious in this group.

Objectives: The objectives of this study are (1) to gain insights into patients' experiences before, during, and after NET concerning changes in PTSD, dissociative and severe mental ill symptoms, care needs (CAN), quality of life, and global functioning; (2) to identify factors that influence diagnostic changes after NET as compared to patients' experiences. These insights will help to decide whether NET should be incorporated in usual care for these patients. Design: A mixed methods convergent design consists of a grounded theory approach with thematic analysis followed by a merged analysis, comparing quantitative, and qualitative data for each participant and by means of a joint matrix. Participants: Adult psychiatric outpatients (age, 21-65) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to repeated interpersonal trauma were indicted for the study. Methods: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were assessed. Qualitative data were collected 3 months after NET using individual semi-structured in-depth interviews. The merged analysis compared quantitative and qualitative results for each participant. Results: Twenty-three outpatients (female, 82%) with a mean age of 49.9 years (SD 9.8) participated in the study. Participants experienced NET as intensive, and most of them tolerated it well. Afterward, eighteen participants perceived less symptoms. Mixed analysis showed substantial congruency between quantitative scores and participants' perceptions of PTSD, dissociative symptoms, and CAN (Cohen's kappa > 0.4). Remission of PTSD was associated with sufficient experienced support. Conclusion: Outpatients with severe mental illness underwent intensive NET, and most of them tolerate it well. This therapy is clearly efficacious in this group.

A deficiency in vitamin B3 can lead to a range of health problems, including Pellagra, which can be life-threatening if left untreated. Treatment for Pellagra typically involves supplementation with vitamin B3 and other nutrients, as well as supportive care to manage symptoms such as diarrhea and confusion. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary to prevent complications such as dehydration or seizures.

I'm sorry to hear about your experience with the Unwanted 72. I know it can be a bit unnerving to feel chest pain, nausea, and dizziness. It's also understandable that you may be concerned about getting pregnant. I'm here to provide you with some information and guidance, but I must emphasize that this is not medical advice. It's always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice and diagnosis.\nFirst, let's talk about the Unwanted 72. It's important to note that this is a hormonal contraceptive method. It contains a synthetic estrogen and a synthetic progestin, which work together to prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. However, it's also important to note that hormonal contraceptives may cause some side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and chest pain. These side effects are generally mild and do not require medical attention. In most cases, they will resolve on their own within a few hours.\nAs for your concern about getting pregnant, it's important to note that the Unwanted 72 is a very effective method of contraception. It has a failure rate of less","finetuned_response":"\nhi, welcome to chatbot forum. it is normal to have vomiting and chest pain within 20 minutes of sex. i have seen many patients who have this problem. it is not dangerous, and you can take paracetamol for chest pain. you are safe from pregnancy. you can get pregnant only if you have sex during your fertile days.  the fertile period starts on the 12th day of the menstrual cycle and ends on the 15th day. you can use condoms to prevent pregnancy. you can also use a hormonal pill to prevent pregnancy.  i hope this information helps you. if you have any further questions, feel free to contact us again.  best wishes, chatbot.  take care.  hope to hear from you soon.  thanks for consulting chatbot.  good day.  chatbot.  wishing you a healthy life.  chatbot.  welcome to chatbot forum.  chatbot.  wishing you a healthy life.  chatbot.  welcome to chatbot forum.  chatbot.  wishing you a healthy life.  chatbot.  welcome to chatbot forum.  chatbot.  wishing you a healthy life.  chatbot.  welcome to chatbot forum.

This is due to the ATP hydrolysis that occurs after the power stroke. ATP binds to the myosin head and causes it to detach from the actin filament, allowing the muscle fiber to relax. The ATP hydrolysis also provides the energy needed for the muscle fiber to return to its resting state. Without ATP hydrolysis, the muscle fiber would remain in a contracted state, leading to muscle fatigue and eventual muscle damage. Therefore, ATP hydrolysis is a critical step in the muscle contraction process, as it allows for the myosin head to detach from the actin filament and for the muscle fiber to relax and return to its resting state. This process is essential for the proper functioning of the skeletal muscle system and is an important factor in maintaining overall muscle health."}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In children, SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness of short duration. Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5\u201317 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5\u201311 years) and older (age 12\u201317 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. FINDINGS: 258 790 children aged 5\u201317 years were reported by an adult proxy between March 24, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between Sept 1, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [62\u00b72%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [55\u00b70%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (IQR 3\u201311) versus 3 days (2\u20137) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order r(s) 0\u00b719, p<0\u00b70001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3\u201312) than younger children (5 days, 2\u20139). 77 (4\u00b74%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [5\u00b71%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [3\u00b71%] of 588 younger children; p=0\u00b7046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [84\u00b74%] of 77), headache (60 [77\u00b79%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [77\u00b79%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1\u20134) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4\u20138). Only 25 (1\u00b78%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 0\u00b79%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 7\u00b77\u201311\u00b70 vs 8, 6\u20139) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 1\u00b75\u20136\u00b75 vs 2, 1\u20134) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. A holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is appropriate.

Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5\u201317 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5\u201311 years) and older (age 12\u201317 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The effects of the first pandemic wave on a German Level I Trauma Center should be evaluated to find ways to redistribute structural, personnel, and financial resources in a targeted manner in preparation for the assumed second pandemic wave. METHODS: We examined the repercussions of the first wave of the pandemic on the trauma surgery clinic of a Level I Trauma Center and compared the data with data from 58 other trauma clinics. The results could aid in orientating the distribution of structural, financial, and human resources (HR) during the second wave. The period between March 16 and April 30, 2020 was compared with the data over the same period during 2019.

The number of polytrauma cases increased by 53%. Hospital days of trauma surgery patients in the intensive and intermediate care wards increased by 90%. The number of operations decreased by 15%, although the operating time outside of normal working hours increased by 44%.

Administration of which of the following is the most appropriate next step","finetuned_response":"E: Alteplase\nThis is a case of carotid dissection which is a tear in the wall of the carotid artery. The patient is presenting with symptoms of a severe headache, neck pain, weakness of the right upper extremity, and sudden loss of vision in the left eye. These symptoms are characteristic of a carotid dissection, which can be caused by trauma or strenuous physical activity. The CT scan of the head showed no abnormalities, but the duplex ultrasonography of the neck showed absence of flow in the left internal carotid artery, which is consistent with a carotid dissection. The most appropriate next step in management is the administration of alteplase, which is a thrombolytic medication that can help to break up the clot that is causing the dissection. Other options such as oxygen, sumatriptan, mannitol, and heparin may also be considered, but they are not as effective in managing carotid dissections. It is important to note that prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential in preventing complications such as stroke or death. Therefore, it is crucial for healthcare providers to be aware of the signs and symptoms of carotid dissection and to administer appropriate treatment as soon as"}
