Many different kinds of animals carry the bacterium; they may become sick but sometimes have no symptoms. Leptospira organisms have been found in cattle, pigs, horses, dogs, rodents, and wild animals. Humans become infected through contact with water, food, or soil containing urine from these infected animals. This may happen by swallowing contaminated food or water or through skin contact, especially with mucosal surfaces, such as the eyes or nose, or with broken skin.

This is a secondary cohort analysis of the DEFUSE 3 data assessing potential predictive variables for mortality in the EVT-treated patients. METHODS The primary outcome was death within 90 days. Patients who died and those who did not were compared statistically. We developed a predictive score using preprocedural variables that were statistically predictive of death in univariate regression analysis (P<0.1). RESULTS Of the 182 patients in the DEFUSE 3 study, 92 (mean age 69 years; 50% male) met our inclusion criteria, and 15.2% of these patients met the primary outcome. Patient age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, wake-up stroke, statin use, and history of diabetes were statistically associated with death. Statin use did not improve the prediction score so was excluded. Thus, our model included four predictors, with one point each given for age >75 years, NIHSS \u226520, wake-up stroke, and diabetes, yielding low (0-1), moderate (2), and high (3-4) risk of death. In the low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk categories, 2\/52 (3.9%), 3\/23 (13.0%), and 9\/17 (52.9%) of patients died, respectively (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Despite selective inclusion criteria and overwhelming benefit for EVT, a substantial number of EVT patients in DEFUSE 3 died. The preprocedural variables age, NIHSS, wake-up stroke, and diabetes may predict this risk. Our predictive score provides a basis for future research to determine which factors influence lethal outcome after EVT.","output":"Prediction of death after endovascular thrombectomy in the extended window: a secondary analysis of DEFUSE 3 \".","__index_level_0__":83374}

We used Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to evaluate relationships. RESULTS: Of 452 Michigan NHs contacted via e-mail, 145 (32.1%) opened the survey and of these, 143 (98.6%) responded. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated their response plan addressed most issues. NHs reported receiving rapidly changing guidance from many sources. Two-thirds reported shortages of personal protective equipment and other supplies. Half (50%) lacked sufficient testing resources with only 36% able to test residents and staff with suspected COVID-19. A majority (55%) experienced staffing shortages. Sixty-three percent experienced resignations, with front-line clinical staff more likely to resign, particularly in facilities caring for COVID-19 patients (P < .001). Facilities adapted quickly, creating COVID-19 units (78%) to care for patients on site. To reduce isolation, NHs facilitated communication via phone calls (98%), videoconferencing (96%), and window visits (81%). A majority continued to provide requisite therapies (90%). CONCLUSIONS: NHs experienced shortages of resources, testing supplies, and staffing challenges. COVID-19 in the facility was a key predictor of staff resignations.

Since the beginning of year 2020, COVID-19 has represented a potential harm for cancer patients and has often hindered oncology care. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. During the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on oncologists' clinical activity and what changes have been made compared with the Italian situation during the first wave of the pandemic. Overall, 138 heads of medical oncology departments participated in this survey: 75 (54%) from the North, 24 (17%) from the Centre and 39 (28%) from the South of Italy and islands. This survey provides an overview of Italian oncologists facing the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The lesson learned during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic has led to a better organisation of clinical activities, and regular testing among healthcare practitioners, with better chances to grant patients' protection. However, the lack of standardised informatic platforms results in serious challenges in replacing frontal visits, often making a concrete reduction of patients' hospital accesses unfeasible. Oncologists need to keep preserving the continuum of care of patients. Standardisation of safety measures, together with the implementation of informatic platforms, can significantly improve oncology pathways during this second wave of COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"Management of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic: The Italian perspective on the second wave","__index_level_0__":89724}

Tracheostomy may be required in critically ill COVID-19 patients to facilitate weaning and to optimize resources like ventilator and ICU beds. Percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT) has become the standard of care globally in ICUs; however, it is considered a high-risk procedure in COVID-19 patients because of the inherent risk of aerosol generation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure for \u226510 days were evaluated for PCT. We developed a four-step approach from patient selection and timing, preparation, performance, and postprocedure for PCT in these patients. RESULTS: We evaluated our four-step protocol in four patients. One of them was non-COVID patient and rest three were COVID patients. The procedure was uneventful in all of the patients with median time of procedure and apnea is 10 minutes 30 seconds and 2 minutes 20 seconds, respectively. The tracheostomy was decannulated in two of these patients and one patient is still on ventilator. CONCLUSION: We believe our four-step protocol for PCT in critically ill COVID-19 patient is simple, safe, and easily adapted in any setting with limited training and available resources. We recommend further studies to evaluate this approach in selected critically ill COVID-19 patients who need tracheostomy. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Nasa P, Singh A, Ali A, Patidar S, Georgian A.

The patient advocacy track at the congress was co-developed with patients, and was integrated into the overall programme. It included four sessions on the financial impact of cancer, treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer, technology, and rare cancers. This comes at a time when there is an increasing focus on the value of real-world data (data from a real-life setting, rather than in a clinical trial) and a more active role for patients and patient organisations as partners in research. Challenges and opportunities arising during the COVID-19 pandemic were also discussed, including logistical complexities in healthcare and consequent uncertainty for patients in accessing care, and opportunities including increased use of telemedicine and broader participation offered by virtual\/on-site hybrid congress formats, as used in ESMO 2021. Data discussed on combination treatments for patients with bladder cancer suggest an improved chance of remission for patients intolerant or resistant to existing treatment. Some of the data from studies in kidney cancer also suggest that treatment breaks or longer periods between treatment can improve quality of life and reduce treatment costs, without reducing treatment effectiveness. Although data on bladder and kidney cancer studies were seen to be promising, the authors recognise the time it takes for such findings to reach clinical practice, and the importance of managing expectations in the patient community. The authors conclude their discussion by reflecting on key challenges and opportunities moving forward, including restoring and improving care and efficiency of cancer services, and working together with patient advocates and advocacy organisations as essential partners in achieving this.

The review included 38 studies, most of which were conducted in China (n = 13) and the United States (n = 11) and published over the last four years (n = 26). Three studies were multicenter investigations, while five articles were based on a national-level survey. The air quality (AQ) was assessed by monitoring stations (n = 24) or dispersion models (n = 7). Many studies were population questionnaire-based, air monitoring and time-series studies, and web-based investigations. A direct association between exposure and perception emerged in 20 studies. This systematic review has shown that most of the studies establish a relationship between risk perception measurement. A broad spectrum of concepts and notions related to perception also emerged, which is undoubtedly an indicator of the wealth of available knowledge and is promising for future research.","output":"Risk Perception of Air Pollution: A Systematic Review Focused on Particulate Matter Exposure","__index_level_0__":65428}
{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Considering the widespread transmission of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally, India is also facing the same crisis. As India already has inadequate waste treatment facilities, and the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to significant growth of Bio-medical waste (BMW), consequently safe disposal of a large quantity of waste has become a more serious concern. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of BMW of India before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this article highlights the gaps in the implementation of BMW rules in India. This study uses various government and non-government organizations, reports and data specifically from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The finding of the study demonstrated that most of the States\/Union Territories (UTs) of India are lacking in terms of COVID-19 waste management. India has generated over 32,996 mt of COVID-19 waste between June and December 2020. During this period, Maharashtra (789.99 mt\/month) is highest average generator of COVID-19 waste, followed by Kerala (459.86 mt\/month), Gujarat (434.87 mt\/month), Tamil Nadu (427.23 mt\/month), Uttar Pradesh (371.39 mt\/month), Delhi (358.83 mt\/month) and West Bengal (303.15 mt\/month), and others respectively. We draw attention to the fact that many gaps were identified with compliance of BMW management rules. For example, out of all 35 States\/UTs, health care facilitates (HCFs), only eight states received authorization as per BMW management rules. Moreover, the government strictly restricted the practice of deep burials; however, 23 States\/UTs are still using the deep burial methods for BMW disposal. The present research suggests that those States\/UTs generated on an average of 100 mt\/month COVID-19 waste in the last 7 months (June-December 2020) should be considered as a high priority state. These states need special attention to implement BMW rules and should upgrade their BMW treatment capacity.","output":"Assessment of bio-medical waste before and during the emergency of novel Coronavirus disease pandemic in India: A gap analysis","__index_level_0__":69087}

METHODS: Twenty-four nurses and 150 individuals who took nucleic acid tests using mobile multifunctional workstations in Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, from September to November 2020, were enrolled in the study as the observation group. As the control group, we included 36 nurses and 150 individuals who did not use the workstations from June to September 2020. We compared the two groups on (1) comfort of working environment, self-perceived security, the convenience of information system, operational process flexibility, pharyngeal acquisition visibility, and effectiveness of communication among nurses; and (2) self-perceived safety, waiting time, and overall satisfaction among individuals who took nucleic acid tests. RESULTS: The satisfaction score of nurses in the observation group of nurses were significantly higher than those of the control group (OR = 17.297 95% CI:4.294, 69.673), as well as the convenience of the information system (OR = 6.250 95% CI: 1.775, 22.008), and communication effectiveness (OR = 5.588 95% CI: 1.590, 19.646). Among individuals who took nucleic acid tests, the overall satisfaction (P < 0.05) and self-perceived security (P < 0.05) had statistical differences between the observation group and the control group.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,402 outpatients with diabetes at a clinic in Osaka, Japan, who responded to an interview sheet regarding lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic between 28 March and 30 May 2020. The association of lifestyle changes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight changes from February to May 2020 was investigated using the linear regression model. We also investigated the association with clinically important change of HbA1c (by &#8805;0.3%) and bodyweight (by &#8805;3%), using the cumulative link model. RESULTS: Leisure time and other outside physical activities were decreased in one-quarter of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the amount of meals and snacks was decreased and increased in approximately 10%, respectively. The change in leisure time physical activities was inversely associated with HbA1c and weight changes, whereas the quantitative change of meals with the decline in eating out and that of snacks were positively associated with HbA1c and weight changes (all P < 0.05). The quantitative change of meals without the decline in eating out was also positively associated with weight change (P = 0.012). The cumulative link model for clinically important HbA1c and weight change showed broadly similar associations, except for that between snacks and bodyweight (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of outpatients with diabetes experienced lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The lifestyle changes were associated with HbA1c and weight changes.","output":"Lifestyle changes and their impact on glycemic control and weight control in patients with diabetes during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Japan","__index_level_0__":87895}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Relevance. During the pandemic of new coronavirus infection, healthcare professionals have increased occupational risks of exposure to the pathogen SARS-CoV-2, as well as physical and psychological stress, especially when treating Covid patients in \u201cred zones\u201d. Such a change in working conditions wasn't reflected in the results of a special assessment, which requires the development of an individual scientifically based approach to its organization in conditions equated to emergency situations. Intention. Evaluate the results of a special assessment of working conditions and their compliance with actual working conditions, taking into account the health risks for healthcare professionals taking care of Covid patients. Methodology. We retrospectively conducted a comparative analysis of 295 cards for a special assessment of the working conditions of medical personnel of military medical organizations of therapeutic and infectious profile over 2015-2019, and 266 cards from the same organizations for 2020. Results and Discussion. Study of cards for special assessment of working conditions of medical personnel of military medical organizations for 2015-2020 showed the leading role of biological factors for all categories of medical personnel. Working in the \u201cRed zone\u201d should be assessed as 3.3 (Degree III harmful) based on biological hazard or 4 (dangerous) due to risks of acute occupational diseases and death. This should be reflected in the results of special assessment of working conditions and compensated via reduction of working hours. However, in the context of the pandemic, actual working hours of healthcare professionals exceeded the established 39 hours per week (Article 350 of the Labor Code of the Russian Federation), and the medical personnel were allowed to work with the pathogen of Group II pathogenicity without preliminary medical examinations. Conclusion. Analysis of the results of special assessment of the working conditions of medical personnel showed that they do not reflect the actual harmful (dangerous) working conditions of employees involved in providing care to patients with new coronavirus infection in these medical and preventive institutions. \u00a9 2021 Medico-Biological and Socio-Psychological Issues of Safety in Emergency Situations.

One way that PTH affects phosphate levels is by acting on the kidney to inhibit renal phosphate reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubule. Normally, the kidneys reabsorb most of the phosphate that is filtered through the glomerulus, but when PTH levels are elevated, the kidneys respond by decreasing the reabsorption of phosphate in the proximal convoluted tubule. This leads to increased excretion of phosphate in the urine, which helps to lower phosphate levels in the blood. However, when PTH levels are too high or too low, it can lead to imbalances in phosphate levels, which can have negative effects on bone health and overall health.","__index_level_0__":19700}

The germinal center is a part of the lymphatic system where B cells undergo a process called somatic hypermutation, which allows them to produce high-affinity antibodies against specific antigens. However, in some cases, this process can lead to the development of genetic mutations that cause the B cells to become cancerous. The exact causes of these mutations are not fully understood, but they may be related to environmental factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals or infections, as well as genetic predisposition. Diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma usually involves a combination of imaging tests, such as CT scans or PET scans, and biopsy of the affected tissue. Treatment options may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and\/or stem cell transplantation, depending on the stage and severity of the disease.","__index_level_0__":26513}

This meta\u2010analysis was conducted to assess the effect of age of COVID\u201019 inpatient on the severity of the disease. METHODS: A systematic literature search up to January 2021 was performed and 5 studies included 910 inpatients with COVID\u201019 disease at the baseline of the study; 773 of them were adult inpatients, and 137 of them were paediatric inpatients. They reported a comparison between adults and children with COVID\u201019 in the level of symptomatic severity, clinical features, computed tomography (CT) results and laboratory results. Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assessing the effect of age of COVID\u201019 inpatient on the severity of the disease using the dichotomous method with a random or fixed\u2010effect model. RESULTS: Adults with COVID\u201019 disease had significantly lower number of mild cases (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04\u20100.77, P = .02); higher number severe cases (OR, 4.90; 95% CI, 2.03\u201011.83, P < .001); higher number of cases with fever (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 2.31\u20107.43, P < .001); and higher number of cases with CT positive COVID\u201019 disease (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.17\u20103.55, P = .001) compared with children. However, no significant difference was found between adults and children in number of cases with shortness of breath (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.41\u20105.04, P = .57); dry cough (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.64\u20104.93, P = .27); leukopenia (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.47\u20101.66, P = .71); lymphopenia (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.49\u20101.88, P = .91); high platelets (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17\u20101.02, P = .05); and high D\u2010dimer (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.43\u20101.56, P = .54).

The practice of endocrinology is suited to provide virtual care to patients with a variety of endocrine disorders. In this survey, we aimed to gauge the adoption of telehealth practices during the COVID-19 pandemic among endocrinologists in the United States (U.S.). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, online survey-based study. Members of the Facebook group \"Endocrinologists\" were invited to participate in the survey. Characteristics of respondents and their rates of adoption of telehealth were described and analyzed for statistically significant associations using the Pearson chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 181 physicians responded to the survey. The majority of respondents were females (75%), younger than or equal to 40 years of age (51%), employed (72%) either by a private group\/hospital or by an academic setting, worked in an urban area (88.4%), and were adult endocrinologists (93%). With the COVID-19 outbreak, more than two-fifths (44.2%) of participants switched to completely virtual visits, and an additional 44.2% switched to a majority of virtual visits, with some in-person visits in the outpatient setting. Additionally, there was a significantly higher adoption rate of telehealth among endocrinologists younger than or equal to 40 years of age (P = .02) and among those who practiced in northeastern, midwestern, and the western geographic regions of the U.S. (P = .04). CONCLUSION: The majority of the responding endocrinologists from the U.S. appeared to have swiftly adapted by using telehealth within a few weeks of COVID-19 being declared a national emergency.

Currently, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a potentially effective treatment option. METHODS: Patients who had recovered from COVID\u201019 and had been discharged from the hospital for more than two weeks were recruited. COVID\u201019 convalescent plasma (CCP)\u2010specific donor screening and selection were performed based the following criteria: 1) aged 18\u201055 years; 2) eligible for blood donation; 3) diagnosed with COVID\u201019; 4) had two consecutive negative COVID\u201019 nasopharyngeal swab tests based on PCR (at least 24 h apart) prior to hospital discharge; 5) had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks; and 6) had no COVID\u201019 symptoms prior to convalescent plasma donation. In addition, preference was given to CCP donors who had a fever lasting more than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5 Celsius, and 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. CCP collection was performed using routine plasma collection procedures via plasmapheresis. In addition to routine donor testing, the CCP donors\u2019 plasma was also tested for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid and S\u2010RBD\u2010specific IgG antibody. RESULTS: Of the 81 potential CCP donors, 64 (79%) plasma products were collected. There were 18 female donors and 46 male donors. There were 34 first\u2010time blood donors and 30 repeat donors. The average time between CCP collection and initial symptom onset was 49.1 days, and the average time between CCP collection and hospital discharge was 38.7 days. The average volume of CCP collected was 327.7 ml. All Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) testing results met blood donation requirements. HIV Ag\/Ab, anti\u2010HCV, anti\u2010syphilis and HBsAg were all negative; NAT for HIV, HBV, and HCV were also negative. In addition, all of the CCP donors\u2019 plasma units were negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. Of the total 64 CCP donors tested, only one had an S\u2010RBD\u2010specific IgG titer of 1:160, all others had a titer of \u22651:320. CONCLUSION: Based on a feasibility study of a pilot CCP program in Wuhan China, we demonstrated the success and feasibility of CCP collection. In addition, all of the CCP units collected had a titer of \u2265 1:160 for S\u2010RBD\u2010specific IgG antibody, which met the CCP quality control requirements based on the Chinese national guidelines for CCP.

The efficient replication and population spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates an effective evasion of human innate immune responses, although the viral proteins responsible for this immune evasion are not clear. In this study, we identified SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, accessory proteins, and the main viral protease as potent inhibitors of host innate immune responses of distinct pathways. In particular, the main viral protease was a potent inhibitor of both the RLR and cGAS-STING pathways. Viral accessory protein ORF3a had the unique ability to inhibit STING, but not the RLR response. On the other hand, structural protein N was a unique RLR inhibitor. ORF3a bound STING in a unique fashion and blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 to inhibit nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling. 3CL of SARS-CoV-2 inhibited K63-ubiquitin modification of STING to disrupt the assembly of the STING functional complex and downstream signaling. Diverse vertebrate STINGs, including those from humans, mice, and chickens, could be inhibited by ORF3a and 3CL of SARS-CoV-2. The existence of more effective innate immune suppressors in pathogenic coronaviruses may allow them to replicate more efficiently in vivo. Since evasion of host innate immune responses is essential for the survival of all viruses, our study provides insights into the design of therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","output":"Unique and complementary suppression of cGAS-STING and RNA sensing- triggered innate immune responses by SARS-CoV-2 proteins","__index_level_0__":107073}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Because in the past vaccines were considered inherently safe, only limited nonclinical testing used to be required. However, from about 2003 more stringent nonclinical testing guidelines were introduced for novel vaccines (and, in some cases, marketed vaccines attempting registration in new markets) given that vaccines are typically administered to healthy individuals, often infants. These safety considerations become even more important as technologies allowing the development of novel vaccine types are developed, such as DNA vaccines and those delivered in vector systems such as adenoviral vectors. The use of adjuvants other than the standard aluminum-based ones and novel delivery systems such as electrostimulation have also led to additional testing requirements. This chapter describes the current regulatory expectations for the preclinical development of vaccines.","output":"Global Regulatory Guidelines for Vaccines","__index_level_0__":62581}

It is defined as the absolute difference in the incidence of the outcome between the two groups. In other words, it is the amount by which the risk of the outcome is reduced in the group receiving the intervention compared to the control group. Absolute risk reduction is an important measure in evaluating the effectiveness of medical interventions and is often used in clinical trials to determine the efficacy of new treatments.","__index_level_0__":4500}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE Sleeping less or more than the 7-8 h has been associated with mortality in the general population, which encompasses diversity in employment status, age and community settings. Since sleep patterns of employed individuals may differ to those of their unemployed counterparts, the nature of their sleep-mortality relationship may vary. We therefore investigated the association between self-reported sleep duration and all-cause mortality (ACM) or cardiovascular disease mortality (CVDM) in employed individuals. DATA SOURCES Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, searches between January 1990 and May 2020 were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Inclusion\/exclusion criteria: Included were prospective cohort studies of 18-64-year-old disease-free employed persons with sleep duration measured at baseline, and cause of death recorded prospectively as the outcome. Gray literature, case-control or intervention design studies were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION Characteristics of the studies, participants, and study outcomes were extracted. The quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. DATA SYNTHESIS The pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained with a random-effects model and results presented as forest plots. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis were assessed. RESULTS Shorter sleep duration (\u22646 h) was associated with a higher risk for (ACM) (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11 -1.22) and CVDM (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.12 -1.41) compared to 7-8 h of sleep, with no significant heterogeneity. The association between longer sleep (\u22658 h) and ACM (RR: 1.18, 95% CI:1.12 -1.23, P < 0.001) needs to be interpreted cautiously owing to high heterogeneity (I2 = 86.0%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Interventions and education programs targeting sleep health in the workplace may be warranted, based on our findings that employed individuals who report shorter sleep appear to have a higher risk for ACM and CVDM.","output":"Associations Between Self-Reported Sleep Duration and Mortality in Employed Individuals: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","__index_level_0__":69609}

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of nutritional status, dietary and behavioural patterns of elementary school children and teenagers in a small town of Colombia. Anthropometric parameters such as BMI Z-score, waist circumference and waist\/height ratio were evaluated in 266 school children and teenagers.

A total of 102 students (38\u22c53 %) were classified as having altered nutritional status, being 39 (14\u22c57 %) classified as overweight and 36 (13\u22c55 %) with obesity.

However, its use can lead to a possible complication known as pseudomembranous colitis, which is caused by the overgrowth of a bacterium called Clostridioides difficile. When someone takes Clindamycin, it can disrupt the normal balance of bacteria in their gut, allowing Clostridioides difficile to grow unchecked. This can lead to inflammation and damage to the lining of the colon, which can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. If left untreated, pseudomembranous colitis can become a serious and potentially life-threatening condition.","__index_level_0__":2665}

A series of outbreaks in the Mediterranean basin between 1950 and 1960 and in Europe and Africa between 1970 and 1980, marking a continuously waxing and waning incidence during the second half of the 20th century.  In America, the virus was first isolated in 1999 in New York City. The WNV disseminated rapidly across the American continent to the West coast in just 4 years and to Argentina in 6 years.   The 2002 outbreak in USA marked the highest rate of neuroinvasive disease of a single WNV outbreak. The total number of infected patients reached 4156, with 2942 (71%) of those suffering severe neuroinvasive disease. \nMost patients with WNV infection are asymptomatic. Accordingly, West Nile fever is considered to be underreported, either because infected patients do not seek medical attention or because they are not tested for the virus.  Between 1999 and 2013, a total 39557 probable and confirmed cases of West Nile fever were reported to the CDC from across the US.   The outbreak of 2012, in which 2873 cases of neuroinvasive disease were reported, occurred during a period of increased mosquito infection rate.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Introduction: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using potential drugs: remdesivir and glucocorticoid in treating children and adolescents with COVID-19 and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in treating MIS-C. Methods: We searched seven databases, three preprint platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google from December 1, 2019, to August 5, 2021, to collect evidence of remdesivir, glucocorticoid, and IVIG which were used in children and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C. Results: A total of six cohort studies and one case series study were included in this systematic review. In terms of remdesivir, the meta-analysis of single-arm cohort studies have shown that, after the treatment, 37.1% (95%CI, 0.0% to 74.5%) experienced adverse events, 5.9% (95%CI, 1.5% to 10.2%) died, 37.2% (95%CI, 0% to 76.0%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation. As for glucocorticoids, the results of the meta-analysis showed that the fixed-effect summary odds ratio for the association with mortality was 2.79 (95%CI, 0.13 to 60.87), and the mechanical ventilation rate was 3.12 (95%CI, 0.80 to 12.08) for glucocorticoids compared with the control group. In terms of IVIG, the two included cohort studies showed that for MIS-C patients with more severe clinical symptoms, IVIG combined with methylprednisolone could achieve better clinical efficacy than IVIG alone. Conclusions: Overall, the current evidence in the included studies is insignificant and of low quality. It is recommended to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials of remdesivir, glucocorticoids, and IVIG in children and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C to provide substantial evidence for the development of guidelines.","output":"Potentially effective drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 in children: a systematic review","__index_level_0__":111889}

OBJECTIVES: This project aimed to determine the presence of HD residue in the patient and staff bathrooms of an ambulatory cancer center. METHODS: A quality improvement project was initiated to examine potential contamination by the HDs 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in a patient bathroom and a secured badge-access staff bathroom in the infusion department of an ambulatory comprehensive cancer center. Twice-daily wipe testing was conducted on the floor in front of the toilet and the flush handle for five consecutive days. FINDINGS: Sixty-five percent of the samples from the floor of the patient bathroom were positive for at least one of the HDs.

There are typically four pairs of branchial clefts, with the second to fourth pairs forming temporary cervical sinuses that are eventually obliterated. These structures are important for the development of the pharyngeal arches, which give rise to various structures in the head and neck, including the jaws, ears, and throat. The branchial clefts also play a role in the formation of the thymus and parathyroid glands. The obliteration of the cervical sinuses is a critical step in embryonic development, as failure to do so can result in the formation of branchial cleft anomalies, such as cysts or fistulas, which can lead to various health problems.","__index_level_0__":16139}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Community pharmacists and their teams have remained accessible to the public providing essential services despite immense pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. AIM: This rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future. METHOD: An embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data were extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations. RESULTS: The 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists' legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy. DISCUSSION: Community pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.","output":"Rapid realist review of the role of community pharmacy in the public health response to COVID-19","__index_level_0__":104590}

The high communicability of the COVID-19 necessitates robust medical preparedness and vigilance. OBJECTIVE: To report on the simulation-based training and test preparedness activities to prepare healthcare workers (HCWs) for effective and safe handling of patients with COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: Two activities were conducted: simulation-based training to all HCWs and a full-scale unannounced simulation-based disaster exercise at King Fahad Medical City (KFMC). The online module was designed to enhance the knowledge on COVID-19. This module was available to all KFMC staff. The five hands-on practical part of the course was available to frontliner HCWs. The unannounced undercover simulated patients\u2019 full-scale COVID-19 simulation-based disaster exercise took place in the emergency department over 3 hours. Six scenarios were executed to test the existing plan in providing care of suspected COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: 2620 HCWs took the online module, 17 courses were conducted and 337 frontliner HCWs were trained. 94% of learners were satisfied and recommended the activity to others. The overall compliance rate of the full-scale COVID-19 disaster drill with infection control guidelines was 90%. Post-drill debriefing sessions recommended reinforcing PPE training, ensuring availability of different sizes of PPEs and developing an algorithm to transfer patients to designated quarantine areas. CONCLUSION: Simulation-based training and preparedness testing activities are vital in identifying gaps to apply corrective actions immediately. In the presence of a highly hazardous contagious disease like COVID-19, such exercises are a necessity to any healthcare institution.","output":"Simulation-based training programme and preparedness testing for COVID-19 using system integration methodology","__index_level_0__":74077}

Methods An online survey among contact lens educators (educator members of the International Association of Contact Lens Educators), conducted in May 2020. Results A total of 214 responses were received from 32 countries (representing a 39% response rate). Overall, 71% of respondents\u2019 institutions were closed to students to attend at that time. A majority (58%) were delivering more online education than they would normally provide. Live online lectures and discussion was the most commonly used method (68%). Zoom was the most common videoconferencing technology (56%) and the most popular social media platform for communicating with students was WhatsApp (48%). About half (54%) were running online exams or assessments, 24% holding these for students to attend in person, and 27% were conducting practical sessions. Two in three (68%) said they would conduct more than 50% of their total teaching online by the end of 2020, and 12% anticipated 90% or more of their teaching would be online. Of all respondents, 74% expressed interest in an online platform delivering educational resources. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the teaching of contact lenses, as educational institutions worldwide move to online delivery. Major challenges remain with online contact lens education, with respect to teaching practical skills, student assessment and interaction. More support will be needed for educators to meet these challenges as the recovery from the pandemic continues.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 on Global Contact Lens Education","__index_level_0__":67426}

Following the peak of the epidemic in mid-March, the curve has slowly fallen thanks to the strict lockdown imposed by the Italian government on 9th March 2020. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. FINDINGS: ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies. FUNDING: The study was supported by Regione Lombardia, Milano Serravalle - Milano Tangenziali S.p.A., Brembo S.p.A, and by MEI System.","output":"COVID-19 and lombardy: TESTing the impact of the first wave of the pandemic","__index_level_0__":94911}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers around the world are experiencing skin injury due to the extended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These injuries are the result of high shear stresses acting on the skin, caused by friction with the PPE. This study aims to provide a practical lubricating solution for frontline medical staff working a 4+ hours shift wearing PPE. METHODS: A literature review into skin friction and skin lubrication was conducted to identify products and substances that can reduce friction. We evaluated the lubricating performance of commercially available products in vivo using a custom-built tribometer. FINDINGS: Most lubricants provide a strong initial friction reduction, but only few products provide lubrication that lasts for four hours. The response of skin to friction is a complex interplay between the lubricating properties and durability of the film deposited on the surface and the response of skin to the lubricating substance, which include epidermal absorption, occlusion, and water retention. INTERPRETATION: Talcum powder, a petrolatum-lanolin mixture, and a coconut oil-cocoa butter-beeswax mixture showed excellent long-lasting low friction. Moisturising the skin results in excessive friction, and the use of products that are aimed at \u2018moisturising without leaving a non-greasy feel\u2019 should be prevented. Most investigated dressings also demonstrate excellent performance.","output":"Evaluating lubricant performance to reduce COVID-19 PPE-related skin injury","__index_level_0__":102003}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine has bridged the distance gap between patients and pediatric urologists for over a decade, yet many pediatric urologists have not embraced it as a major part of their practice. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate and clarify the optimal role of telemedicine in pediatric urology, as well as the benefits, barriers, risks, and other important considerations that must be accounted for in its optimal adoption. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this systematic review utilized Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to search PubMed through April 29, 2021 as follows: (Humans [MeSH]) AND ((Child [MeSH]) OR (Infant [MeSH])) AND ((Remote Consultation [MAJR]) OR (Telemedicine [MAJR]) OR (Videoconferencing [MAJR]) OR (Health Services Accessibility [MAJR])) AND ((Urology [MAJR]) OR (Postoperative Care [MAJR]) OR (Urologic Surgical Procedures [MAJR])). 73 resulting articles, plus 21 from manual searches (e.g. papers too recent to have MeSH terms), were screened. 17 met inclusion criteria by discussing telemedicine in context of pediatric urology in a full manuscript. Non-complete manuscripts and papers not specifically considering pediatric urology, or in which telemedicine was not a major focus, were excluded. RESULTS: 17 papers met inclusion criteria. Varied approaches to the topic included surveys, controlled studies, retrospective studies, and descriptive opinion pieces. Quality of evidence varied, representing at least 1851 virtual encounters, 409 in-person encounters, and 68 clinician opinions. Four papers included a comparison or control group, and none utilized randomization. All 17 papers support expanded application of telemedicine in pediatric urology with varied evidence that telemedicine improves patient access to pediatric urologic care, satisfies both patient families and clinicians, is safe, provides equivalent outcomes, and is practicable. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of telemedicine in pediatric urology should be expanded as it can practicably and safely improve patient access to pediatric urologic care, satisfy both patient families and clinicians, and maintain outcomes.","output":"Systematic review of telemedicine in pediatric urology","__index_level_0__":62503}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Aichi virus (AiV), a member of the genus Kobuvirus in the family Picornaviridae, causes gastroenteritis in humans. It was noted that AiV differs from other picornaviruses in its unusually high C content and a very high degree of genome-ordered RNA secondary structures. However, the genetic variability and mutational restrictions on a full-genome scale have not been studied. In addition to the available five complete AiV genomes, we determined here another five complete coding sequences of AiV sampled in Germany, 2004. Distinctive AiV genetic features included a low incidence of recombination along the genome without obvious hotspots or spared regions and very low rates of synonymous and non-synonymous variation, supporting an absence of AiV serotypes. In addition, the absence of recombination between AiV genotypes A and B suggested the existence of reproductive isolation between taxonomic units below the species level. In contrast to most other picornaviruses, AiV genomes strongly avoided the UpA dinucleotide, while there was no obvious selection against the CpG dinucleotide. AiV genomes also appeared to contain a codon usage bias (CUB) apparent as an effective number of codons of 39.5, which was amongst the most extreme among RNA viruses. A set of sequence scrambling algorithms was developed to determine the origin of CUB in AiV. While in most picornaviruses the genomic dinucleotide content contributed significantly to CUB, in AiV its extreme nucleotide content, i.e. 57 % third codon position C, was the main driving force behind the apparent CUB.","output":"Genetic variation and recombination in Aichi virus.","__index_level_0__":81550}

Materials and methods This was a retrospective, observational, single-center study, which included all patients who presented to the rehabilitation clinic at the King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam (KFSHD) from January to August 2020 (study period), and they were matched with parallel groups from 2017 to 2019 (control period). Results A total number of 1,435 patient visits were recorded in the outpatient rehabilitation clinics during the study period as compared to the 1,496 patient visits during the control period. However, the number of patients seen by the speech therapists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists significantly came down from 482, 963, and 171, respectively in the control period to 77, 218, and 130, respectively in the study period. The occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy services were significantly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Our findings revealed the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outpatient rehabilitation services, which was reflected in the sharp decline in the number of patients who attended the rehabilitation clinics as well as in the reduced number of sessions. The rehabilitation facilities should be better prepared for such pandemics in the future to deliver appropriate and timely rehabilitation programs with a patient-centered approach.","output":"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Rehabilitation Services in a Tertiary Care Hospital in the Eastern Region of Saudi Arabia: A Single-Center Study","__index_level_0__":89666}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Objectives : Although several randomized controlled trials have compared the efficacy of remdesivir with that of placebo, there is limited evidence regarding its effect in the early stage of nonsevere COVID-19 cases. Methods : We evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir on the early stage of nonsevere COVID-19 using the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Japan. Two regimens (start remdesivir therapy within 4 days from admission vs. no remdesivir during hospitalization) among patients without the need for supplementary oxygen therapy were compared by a three-step processing (cloning, censoring, and weighting) method. The primary outcome was a supplementary oxygen requirement during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were 30-day in-hospital mortality and the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV\/ECMO). The data of 12,487 cases met our inclusion criteria. The \u201cstart remdesivir\u201d regimen showed a lower risk of supplementary oxygen requirement (hazard ratio: 0.850, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.798\u20130.906, p value < 0.001). Both 30-day in-hospital mortality and risk of IMV\/ECMO introduction were not significantly different between the two regimens (hazard ratios: 1.04 and 0.983, 95% CI: 0.980\u20131.09 and 0.906\u20131.07, p values: 0.210 and 0.678, respectively).

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MedRxiv from inception to November 2020 were searched to identify documents. STUDY SELECTION: Publications investigating the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on lung function (forced vital capacity [FVC]), exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance [6MWD]), health related quality of life (HRQOL), and dyspnea were searched. DATA EXTRACTION: The data were extracted into predesigned data extraction tables. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0). DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 11 RCTs with 637 interstitial lung disease patients were eligible for analyses. The pooled effect sizes of the association for pulmonary rehabilitation were 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.71) for FVC, 44.55 (95% CI, 32.46-56.64) for 6MWD, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.22-0.82) for HRQOL, and 0.39 (95% CI, -0.08 to 0.87) for dyspnea. After translating these findings considering clinical improvements, pulmonary rehabilitation intervention increased predicted FVC by 5.5%, the 6MWD test improved by 44.55 m, and HRQOL improved by 3.9 points compared with baseline values.

{"instruction":"Answer this question truthfully","input":"What causes an Eyelid twitch?","output":"The most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, and caffeine. Once spasms begin, they may continue off and on for a few days. Then, they disappear. Most people experience this type of eyelid twitch on occasion and find it very annoying. In most cases, you won't even notice when the twitch has stopped.\nMore severe contractions, where the eyelid completely closes, are possible. These can be caused by irritation of the surface of the eye (cornea) or the membranes lining the eyelids (conjunctiva).\nSometimes, the reason your eyelid is twitching cannot be identified. This form of eyelid twitching lasts much longer, is often very uncomfortable, and can also cause your eyelids to close completely.","__index_level_0__":49172}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, genetic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 emerge, and some of them are found more contagious than the previously identified strains, acting as the major mechanism for many large-scale epidemics. The transmission advantage of mutated variants is widely believed as an innate biological feature that cannot be altered by artificial factors. In this study, we explore how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) may affect transmission advantage. A two-strain compartmental epidemic model is proposed and simulated to investigate the biological mechanism of the relationships among different NPIs, the changes in transmissibility of each strain and transmission advantage. Although the NPIs are effective in flattening the epidemic curve, we demonstrate that NPIs probably lead to a decline in transmission advantage, which is likely to occur if the NPIs become intensive. Our findings uncover the mechanistic relationship between NPIs and transmission advantage dynamically, and highlight the important role of NPIs not only in controlling the intensity of epidemics but also in showing or even containing the growth of the proportion of mutated variants.","output":"The non-pharmaceutical interventions may affect the advantage in transmission of mutated variants during epidemics: A conceptual model for COVID-19","__index_level_0__":92002}

{"instruction":"Answer this question truthfully","input":"What does corpus luteum mean?","output":"It is essential for establishing and maintaining pregnancy in females.\nIn the ovary, the corpus luteum secretes estrogens and progesterone, which are steroid hormones responsible for the thickening of the endometrium and its development and maintenance, respectively.\nIf the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum stops secreting progesterone and decays (after approximately 14 days in humans). It then degenerates into a corpus albicans, which is a mass of fibrous scar tissue.\nThe uterine lining sloughs off without progesterone and is expelled through the vagina (in humans and some great apes, which go through a menstrual cycle). In an estrus cycle the lining degenerates back to normal size.\nIf fertilized, however, the embryo secretes the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or a similar hormone in other species.\nThis hormone signals the corpus luteum to continue progesterone secretion, thereby maintaining the thick lining (endometrium) of the uterus, and providing an area rich in blood vessels in which the zygote (s) can develop. From this point on, the corpus luteum is called the corpus luteum graviditatis.\nThe introduction of the hormone prostaglandin at this point causes the degeneration of the corpus luteum and the abortion of the fetus. However, in placental animals such as humans the placenta eventually takes over progesterone production and the corpus luteum degrades into a corpus albicans without embryo\/fetus loss.","__index_level_0__":42580}

Employing a latent class analysis (LCA), we classified the respondents based on three items capturing the extent to which participants would support allowing three groups of immigrants to enter and live in their countries: immigrants of same ethnic groups, immigrants of different ethnic groups, and immigrants from poorer countries outside Europe. Four classes of Europeans with mutually exclusive response patterns with respect to their inclusive attitudes towards immigrants were found. The classes were named Inclusive (highly inclusive), Some (selective), Few (highly selective), and Exclusive (highly exclusive). Next, using a network technique, a partial correlation network of 10 basic human values was estimated for each class of participants. The four networks were compared to each other based on three network properties namely: global connectivity, community detection, and assortativity coefficient. The global connectivity (the overall level of interconnections) between the 10 basic values was found to be mostly invariant across the four networks. However, results of the community detection analysis revealed a more complex value structure among the most inclusive class of Europeans. Further, according to the assortativity analysis, as expected, for the most inclusive Europeans, values with similar motivational backgrounds were found to be interconnected most strongly to one another.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) programs are designed to minimise rates of preventable healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and acquisition of multidrug resistant organisms, which are among the commonest adverse effects of hospitalisation. Failures of hospital IPC in recent years have led to nosocomial and community outbreaks of emerging infections, causing preventable deaths and social disruption. Therefore, effective IPC programs are essential, but can be difficult to sustain in busy clinical environments. Healthcare workers\u2019 adherence to routine IPC practices is often suboptimal, but there is evidence that doctors, as a group, are consistently less compliant than nurses. This is significant because doctors\u2019 behaviours disproportionately influence those of other staff and their peripatetic practice provides more opportunities for pathogen transmission. A better understanding of what drives doctors\u2019 IPC practices will contribute to development of new strategies to improve IPC, overall. METHODS: This qualitative case study involved in-depth interviews with senior clinicians and clinician-managers\/directors (16 doctors and 10 nurses) from a broad range of specialties, in a large Australian tertiary hospital, to explore their perceptions of professional and cultural factors that influence doctors\u2019 IPC practices, using thematic analysis of data. RESULTS: Professional\/clinical autonomy; leadership and role modelling; uncertainty about the importance of HAIs and doctors\u2019 responsibilities for preventing them; and lack of clarity about senior consultants\u2019 obligations emerged as major themes. Participants described marked variation in practices between individual doctors, influenced by, inter alia, doctors\u2019 own assessment of patients\u2019 infection risk and their beliefs about the efficacy of IPC policies.

Preliminary calculations have been carried out, which have shown the effectiveness of the reimbursement of rental space to enterprises. The basis for such calculations was the concept of increasing tax profits obtained from deductions from enterprises to the regional and federal budgets. The conditions that the company must accept as obligations in case of a positive decision regarding the reimbursement of rent payments from the regional budget are given.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought dramatic changes in the delivery of primary health care across the world, presumably changing the number of consultations for infectious diseases and antibiotic use. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on infections and antibiotic prescribing in Dutch primary care. All patients included in the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners' Network were followed from March through May 2019 (n = 389,708) and March through May 2020 (n = 405,688). We extracted data on consultations for respiratory\/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal and skin infections using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. These consultations were combined in disease episodes and linked to antibiotic prescriptions. The numbers of infectious disease episodes (total and those treated with antibiotics), complications, and antibiotic prescription rates (i.e., proportion of episodes treated with antibiotics) were calculated and compared between the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Fewer episodes were observed during the pandemic months than in the same months in 2019 for both the four infectious disease entities and complications such as pneumonia, mastoiditis and pyelonephritis. The largest decline was seen for gastrointestinal infections (relative risk (RR), 0.54; confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 0.58) and skin infections (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.67 to 0.75). The number of episodes treated with antibiotics declined as well, with the largest decrease seen for respiratory\/ear infections (RR, 0.54; CI, 0.52 to 0.58). The antibiotic prescription rate for respiratory\/ear infections declined from 21% to 13% (difference -8.0% (CI, -8.8 to -7.2)), yet the prescription rates for other infectious disease entities remained similar or increased slightly. The decreases in primary care infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use were most pronounced in weeks 15-19, mid-COVID-19 wave, after an initial peak in respiratory\/ear infection presentation in week 11, the first week of lock-down. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the presentation of infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use in primary care in the Netherlands. Consequently, the number of infectious disease episodes treated with antibiotics decreased. We found no evidence of an increase in complications.","output":"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Antibiotic Prescribing for Common Infections in The Netherlands: A Primary Care-Based Observational Cohort Study","__index_level_0__":97140}

So, far, millions of people are infected with the virus across the length and breadth of the world with thousand losing their lives each passing day. The WHO in February 2020 classified the virus as a coronavirus and the name Coronavirus-19 (CoV-19) was offered to the virus. The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with elevation of several immune plays as well as inflammatory factors which contributes to cytokine storms. Currently, the detection of CoV-19 RNA is through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of suppressing several kinds of cytokines via the paracrine secretion system. Therefore, MSCs therapy could be game charges in the treatment of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, intravenous IG may be capable of suppressing the high expression of IL-6 by the CoV-19 resulting in lessen disease burden. Anti-inflammatory medications like, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, glycyrrhetinic acid, as well as etoposide may be very advantageous in decreasing the COVID-19 burden because, their mode of action targets the cytokine storms initiated by the CoV-19. It is important to indicate that, these medication does not target the virus itself. Therefore, potent CoV-19 anti-viral medications are needed to completely cure patients with COVID-19. Also, a vaccine is urgently needed to stop the spread of the virus.

METHODS: The centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Integrated Data Repository, including the Medicare beneficiary enrollment database, was accessed in June 2015, February 2017, and February 2018. We evaluated patterns of delay in Medicare claims accrual, and used incomplete, non-final claims data to develop and validate models for real-time estimation of admissions, readmissions, and observation stays. RESULTS: These real-time reporting models accurately estimate, within 2 months from admission, the monthly numbers of admissions, 30-day readmission and observation-stay rates for patients with AMI, HF, or pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: This work will allow CMS to track the impact of policy decisions in real time and enable hospitals to better monitor their performance nationally.","output":"Timely estimation of National Admission, readmission, and observation-stay rates in medicare patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia using near real-time claims data","__index_level_0__":72966}

Hyperammonemia is a medical condition in which there is an excess of ammonia in the blood, usually due to liver dysfunction or a genetic disorder. Ammonia is a toxic substance that can cause neurological symptoms and damage if it accumulates in the body. One of the ways to manage hyperammonemia is to reduce the amount of protein in the diet, since protein breakdown produces ammonia as a byproduct. This can be achieved by avoiding high-protein foods such as meat, fish, and dairy products, and replacing them with low-protein alternatives such as fruits, vegetables, and grains. In addition to dietary changes, other treatments for hyperammonemia may include medications, dialysis, or liver transplant depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition.","__index_level_0__":21059}

The anti-viral activities from several ayurvedic herbal medicines (in the form of crude extract or fraction or isolated compounds) have been established but their effectiveness against coronavirus still needs to be explored.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Posttransplant metabolic syndrome (PTMS) is a common contributor to morbidity and mortality among solid organ transplant recipients in the late posttransplant period (\u22651 year). Patients diagnosed with PTMS are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and frequently experience decreased physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Studies in the early posttransplant period (<1 year) have shown the benefits of facility-based exercise training on physical function and HRQL, but have not evaluated the effects on metabolic risk factors. It remains unclear whether home-based exercise programs are feasible and can be delivered at a sufficient exercise dose to have effects on PTMS. This protocol outlines the methodology of a randomized controlled trial of a partly supervised home-based exercise program in lung transplant (LTx) and orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility (ie, recruitment rate, program adherence, attrition, safety, and participant satisfaction) of a 12-week individualized, home-based aerobic and resistance training program in LTx and OLT recipients initiated 12 to 18 months after transplantation, and to assess estimates of intervention efficacy on metabolic risk factors, exercise self-efficacy, and HRQL. METHODS: In total, 20 LTx and 20 OLT recipients with \u22652 cardiometabolic risk factors at 12 to 18 months after transplantation will be randomized to an intervention (home-based exercise training) or control group. The intervention group will receive an individualized exercise prescription comprising aerobic and resistance training, 3 to 5 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants will meet on a weekly basis (via videoconference) with a qualified exercise professional who will supervise exercise progression, provide support, and support exercise self-efficacy. Participants in both study groups will receive a counseling session on healthy eating with a dietitian at the beginning of the intervention. For the primary aim, feasibility will be assessed through recruitment rate, program adherence, satisfaction, attrition, and safety parameters. Secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks, including assessments of metabolic risk factors (ie, insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, blood pressure, and cholesterol), HRQL, and exercise self-efficacy. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize program feasibility and effect estimates (means and 95% CIs) for sample size calculations in future trials. RESULTS: Enrollment started in July 2021. It is estimated that the study period will be 18 months, with data collection to be completed by December 2022. CONCLUSIONS: A partly supervised home-based, individually tailored exercise program that promotes aerobic and resistance training and exercise self-efficacy may be an important intervention for improving the metabolic profile of LTx and OLT recipients with cardiometabolic risk factors. Thus, characterizing the feasibility and effect estimates of home-based exercise constitutes the first step in developing future clinical trials designed to reduce the high morbidity associated with PTMS.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing global COVID-19 pandemic since 2019 has led to increasing amount of research to study how to do fast screening and diagnosis to efficiently detect COVID-19 positive cases, and how to prevent spreading of the virus. Our research objective was to study whether SARS-CoV-2 could be detected from routine nasopharyngeal swab samples by using attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy coupled with partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The advantage of ATR-FTIR is that measurements can be conducted without any sample preparation and no reagents are needed. Our study included 558 positive and 558 negative samples collected from Northern Finland. Overall, we found moderate diagnostic performance for ATR-FTIR when polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used as the gold standard: the average area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) was 0.67-0.68 (min. 0.65, max. 0.69) with 20, 10 and 5 k-fold cross validations. Mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity was 0.62-0.63 (min. 0.60, max. 0.65), 0.61 (min. 0.58, max. 0.65) and 0.64 (min. 0.59, max. 0.67) with 20, 10 and 5 k-fold cross validations. As a conclusion, our study with relatively large sample set clearly indicate that measured ATR-FTIR spectrum contains specific information for SARS-CoV-2 infection (P<0.001 in label permutation test). However, the diagnostic performance of ATR-FTIR remained only moderate, potentially due to low concentration of viral particles in the transport medium. Further studies are needed before ATR-FTIR can be recommended for fast screening of SARS-CoV-2 from routine nasopharyngeal swab samples.","output":"Diagnostic performance of attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy for detecting COVID-19 from routine nasopharyngeal swab samples","__index_level_0__":102880}
{"instruction":"Answer this question truthfully","input":"How does using a placebo help reduce measurement bias in interventions?","output":"Using a placebo helps reduce measurement bias in interventions by allowing researchers to blind the interventions. This means that participants are unaware of whether they are receiving the actual intervention or a placebo, which reduces the likelihood of bias in their self-reported outcomes. By blinding the interventions, researchers can more accurately measure the true effects of the intervention, rather than the effects of participant expectations or other factors that may influence the outcome.

Disease severity has been associated with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines and lymphopenia. To elucidate the atlas of peripheral immune response and pathways that might lead to immunopathology during COVID-19 disease course, we performed a peripheral blood RNA sequencing analysis of the same patient's samples collected from symptom onset to full recovery. We found that PBMCs at different disease stages exhibited unique transcriptome characteristics. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection caused excessive release of inflammatory cytokines and lipid mediators as well as an aberrant increase of low-density neutrophils. Further analysis revealed an increased expression of RNA sensors and robust IFN-stimulated genes expression but a repressed type I IFN production. SARS-CoV-2 infection activated T and B cell responses during the early onset but resulted in transient adaptive immunosuppression during severe disease state. Activation of apoptotic pathways and functional exhaustion may contribute to the reduction of lymphocytes and dysfunction of adaptive immunity, whereas increase in IL2, IL7, and IL15 may facilitate the recovery of the number and function of lymphocytes.

For oleic acid\/oleylamine, we observe a fast decay accompanied by the formation of elemental lead and halogen. Upon surface functionalization with a metal porphyrin derivative, the decay is markedly slower and involves the disproportionation of lead to Pb0 and Pb3+. In both cases, the decomposition is preceded by a contraction of the atomic lattice, which appears to initiate the decay. We find that the metal porphyrin derivative induces a strong surface dipole on the nanocrystals, which we hold responsible for the altered and slower decomposition pathway. These results are important for application of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals in X-ray scintillators.","output":"Mitigating the photodegradation of all-inorganic mixed-halide perovskite nanocrystals by ligand exchange","__index_level_0__":110232}

This study aimed at addressing the current knowledge gap by carrying out an online survey in Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The analysis included a final sample of 817 AYCs aged 15\u201317 years old. AYCs of grandparents (GrPs) were compared to AYCs of other care recipients (OCRs), in order to identify any difference in positive and negative caregiving outcomes and exposure factors between the two groups. Linear or logistic regression models were built, and multivariate analyses were repeated, including a fixed effect on the country variable. AYCs of GrPs experienced more positive caregiving outcomes than AYCs of OCRs across all six countries. Being female or non-binary, and having a migration background, were associated with more negative outcomes, regardless of the relationship with the care recipient. Further research on intergenerational caregiving outcomes is recommended for shaping measures and policies, which preserve the intergenerational emotional bonds, whilst protecting AYCs from inappropriate responsibilities, undermining their mental health and well-being.","output":"Positive and Negative Impacts of Caring among Adolescents Caring for Grandparents.

{"instruction":"Answer this question truthfully","input":"What is primary hemochromatosis and what genetic mutations are associated with it?","output":"Primary hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron from the diet, leading to iron overload and damage to organs such as the liver, heart, and pancreas. This condition is caused by mutations in the HFE gene on chromosome 6, which regulates the absorption and storage of iron in the body. These mutations lead to increased expression of DMT1, a protein that transports iron across cell membranes, and decreased synthesis of hepcidin, a hormone that regulates iron absorption and storage. As a result, individuals with primary hemochromatosis accumulate excessive amounts of iron in their tissues and organs, which can lead to serious health problems if left untreated.","__index_level_0__":19916}
{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the aetiology, clinical features and prognosis of CAP during the first post-pandemic influenza season. We also assessed the factors associated with severe disease and tested the ability of a scoring system for identifying influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia. METHODS: Prospective cohort study carried out at 10 tertiary hospitals of Spain. All adults hospitalised with CAP from December 01, 2010 to March 31, 2011 were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 747 adults with CAP required hospitalisation. The aetiology was determined in 315 (42.2%) patients, in whom 154 (21.9%) were due to bacteria, 125 (16.7%) were due to viruses and 36 (4.8%) were mixed (due to viruses and bacteria). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Streptococccus pneumoniae. Among patients with viral pneumonia, the most common organism identified were influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. Independent factors associated with severe disease were impaired consciousness, septic shock, tachypnea, hyponatremia, hypoxemia, influenza B, and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09. The scoring system evaluated did not differentiate reliably between patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia and those with other aetiologies. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of bacterial and viral pneumonia during the first post-pandemic influenza season was similar. The main identified virus was influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, which was associated with severe disease. Although certain presenting clinical features may allow recognition of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia, it is difficult to express them in a reliable scoring system.","output":"Community-acquired pneumonia during the first post-pandemic influenza season: A prospective, multicentre cohort study","__index_level_0__":90422}

This means that individuals with primary lactase deficiency may have normal lactose tolerance in infancy and early childhood, but as they age, their ability to digest lactose decreases, leading to symptoms of lactose intolerance such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea after consuming dairy products. The decline in lactose tolerance is due to a reduction in lactase activity in the small intestine, which is caused by genetic factors that regulate the expression of the lactase gene. While primary lactase deficiency is a common cause of lactose intolerance, there are other factors that can also contribute to lactose intolerance, such as gastrointestinal diseases or infections.","__index_level_0__":19941}

{"instruction":"Answer this question truthfully","input":"What is meant by Hepatic failure?","output":"Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) refers to acute renal failure that occurs in the setting of cirrhosis or fulminant liver failure associated with portal hypertension, usually in the absence of other disease of the kidney. It is a direct result of changes in the splanchnic and systemic circulation from cirrhosis or fulminant hepatic failure. It is usually secondary to trigger events which cause multi-system organ failure.\nBecause of the high mortality associated with hepatorenal syndrome, emphasis is on prevention in patients who are at risk for the condition. Strategies for avoiding hepatorenal syndrome include appropriate and non-aggressive use of diuretics, identification and early treatment of infection and hemorrhage, and avoidance of other toxins that can affect both the liver and kidney. \nThe definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation, and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation. These treatment strategies include the following: \nAll major studies showing improvement in renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome have involved expansion of the volume of the plasma with albumin given intravenously   One regimen is 1 gm albumin per kg of body weight intravenously on day one followed by followed by 20-40 grams daily. \nMidodrine is an alpha-agonist and octreotide is an analog of somatostatin. The medications are respectively systemic vasoconstrictors and inhibitors of vasodilators, and were not found to be useful when used individually in the treatment of the hepatorenal syndrome.  However, one study of 13 patients with hepatorenal syndrome showed significant improvement when the two were used together (with midodrine given orally, octreotide given subcutaneously and both dosed according to blood pressure), with three patients surviving to discharge.  A nonrandomized, observational study used \"100 \u03bcg subcutaneously TID, with the goal to increase the dose to 200 \u03bcg subcutaneous TID\" and \"midodrine administration started at 5, 7.5, or 10 mg TID orally, with the goal to increase the dose to 12.5 or 15 mg if necessary\" and found that \" octreotide \/ midodrine treatment appears to improve 30-day survival\". \nThe vasopressin analogue ornipressin was found in a number of studies to be useful in improvement of renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome,   but has been limited by ischemic complications . Terlipressin is a vasopressin analogue that has been found in one study to be useful for improving renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome with a lesser incidence of ischemia.  Neither medication is available for use in North America.\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS) involve decompression of the high pressures in the portal circulation by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein. They have also been shown to improve renal function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome.  \nLiver dialysis involves extracorporeal dialysis to remove toxins from the circulation. The molecular adsorbents recirculation system (MARS) has shown some utility as a bridge to transplantation in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. \nRenal replacement therapy may be required to'bridge' the patient to liver transplantation, although the condition of the patient may dictate the modality used. \nOther agents used in treatment include\nPentoxifylline, Acetylcysteine,  Misoprostol.","__index_level_0__":36392}
{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Since the initial reports of COVID-19 in December 2019, the world has been gripped by the disastrous acute respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. There are an ever-increasing number of reports of neurological symptoms in patients, from severe (encephalitis), to mild (hyposmia), suggesting the potential for neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2. This Perspective investigates the hypothesis that the reliance on self-reporting of hyposmia has resulted in an underestimation of neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients. While the acute effect of the virus on the nervous system function is vastly overshadowed by the respiratory effects, we propose that it will be important to monitor convalescent individuals for potential long-term implications that may include neurodegenerative sequelae such as viral-associated parkinsonism. As it is possible to identify premorbid harbingers of Parkinson's disease, we propose long-term screening of SARS-CoV-2 cases post-recovery for these expressions of neurodegenerative disease. An accurate understanding of the incidence of neurological complications in COVID-19 requires long-term monitoring for sequelae after remission and a strategized health policy to ensure healthcare systems all over the world are prepared for a third wave of the virus in the form of parkinsonism.","output":"Parkinsonism as a Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic?","__index_level_0__":86024}

Over 8,000 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic. We report the safety and immunogenicity of a SARS DNA vaccine in a Phase I human study. METHODS: A single-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Spike (S) glycoprotein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults. Nine subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses. Immune response was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), ELISpot, ELISA, and neutralization assays. RESULTS: The vaccine was well-tolerated. SARS-CoV-specific antibody was detected by ELISA in 8 of 10 subjects and neutralizing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine. SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T cell responses were detected in all vaccinees, and CD8+ T cell responses in \u223c20% of individuals.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: We recently identified DOCK8 as a novel gene associated with cytokine storm syndrome (CSS)1. Heterozygous missense mutations in DOCK8 diminish NK cell lytic function and contribute to increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production (CSS). CSS is a potential complication of COVID-19 with severe consequences2. Children are at risk of a SARS-CoV-2 post-infectious CSS, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)3. Host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 CSS and MIS-C CSS are unknown. Objectives: The goals are to identify and functionally study rare mutations in DOCK8 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 and MIS-C. Methods: To date, 16 adult patients enrolled in a COVID-19 CSS clinical trial at UAB had whole genome sequencing. Four (25%) had rare heterozygous DOCK8 mutations (3 missense, 1 intronic). A COVID-19 CSS adult patient in Seattle also had a DOCK8 missense mutation. In addition, DOCK8 missense mutations were identified in five children (UAB & Northwell) hospitalized with MIS-C. DOCK8 mutations, or wild-type (WT) sequence controls, were introduced into human NK-92 cells by FOAMY virus transduction. WT and mutant DOCK8-expressing NK-92 cells were incubated with K562 target cells and compared for cytolysis and degranulation (CD107a). Results: One COVID-19 patient DOCK8 mutation (Gly523Arg) reduced NK cell degranulation by 30% and cytolysis by 23% (n=3) (Figure 1). Similar studies of 3 MIS-C patients with DOCK8 missense mutations (Arg899Trp, Ala2Thr, Pro-687Leu) revealed up to 31% reduced NK cell degranulation and 48% reduction in cytolysis by 3 distinct mutations (n=3). Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed statistically significant (p<0.05) differences in NK cell degranulation and lysis for four unique DOCK8 mutations. Conclusion: Heterozygous DOCK8 missense mutations may contribute to severe COVID-19 and MIS-C CSS by partial dominant-negative effects yielding decreased NK cell cytolysis.","output":"Dock8 mutations in covid-19 and mis-c cytokine storm syndrome","__index_level_0__":82786}

Characteristic findings are the absence of P waves, with unorganized electrical activity in their place, and irregularity of R-R interval due to irregular conduction of impulses to the ventricles. If paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is suspected and 12-lead ECG is normal, usage of a 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitor is recommended. Typical electrocardiogram findings in a patient with atrial fibrillation are absent P waves, irregularly irregular ventricular response rate, and an atrial rate that ranges from 400 to 700 BPM.

{"instruction":"Answer this question truthfully","input":"What causes Vaginitis?","output":"Vulvovaginitis can affect women of all ages and is extremely common. It can be caused by bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and other parasites. Some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can also cause vulvovaginitis, as can various chemicals found in bubble baths, soaps, and perfumes. Environmental factors such as poor hygiene and allergens may also cause this condition. Candida albicans, which causes yeast infections, is one of the most common causes of vulvovaginitis in women of all ages. Antibiotic use can lead to yeast infections by killing the normal antifungal bacteria that live in the vagina. Yeast infections typically cause genital itching and a thick, white vaginal discharge, and other symptoms.\nAnother cause of vulvovaginitis is bacterial vaginosis, an overgrowth of certain types of bacteria in the vagina. Bacterial vaginosis may cause a thin, grey vaginal discharge and a fishy odor. An STI called trichomonas vaginitis infection is another common cause. This infection leads to genital itching, a vaginal odor, and a heavy vaginal discharge, which may be yellow-grey or green in color.\nBubble baths, soaps, vaginal contraceptives, feminine sprays, and perfumes can cause irritating itchy rashes in the genital area, while tight-fitting or nonabsorbent clothing sometimes cause heat rashes. Irritated tissue is more susceptible to infection than normal tissue, and many infection-causing organisms thrive in environments that are warm, damp, and dark. Not only can these factors contribute to the cause of vulvovaginitis, they frequently prolong the recovery period. A lack of estrogen in postmenopausal women can result in vaginal dryness and thinning of vaginal and vulvar skin, which may also lead to or worsen genital itching and burning. Some skin conditions can cause itching and chronic irritation of the vulvar area. Foreign bodies, such as lost tampons, can also cause vulvar irritation and itching and strong smelling discharge. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis (where specific cause cannot be identified) can be seen in all age groups, but it occurs most commonly in young girls before puberty. Once puberty begins, the vagina becomes more acidic, which tends to help prevent infections. Nonspecific vulvovaginitis can occur in girls with poor genital hygiene and is characterized by a foul-smelling, brownish-green discharge and irritation of the labia and vaginal opening. This condition is often associated with an overgrowth of a type of bacteria that is typically found in the stool. These bacteria are sometimes spread from the rectum to the vaginal area by wiping from back to front after using the bathroom. Sexual abuse should be considered in children with unusual infections and recurrent episodes of unexplained vulvovaginitis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the organism that causes gonorrhea, produces gonococcal vulvovaginitis in young girls who have sexual exposure. Gonorrhea-related vaginitis is considered a sexually transmitted illness. If lab tests confirm this diagnosis, young girls should be evaluated for sexual abuse.","__index_level_0__":48063}

OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of robotic training on upper limb function, activities of daily living (ADL) and training experience in subacute tetraplegic inpatients. SETTING: Inpatient subacute Norwegian spinal cord injury (SCI) unit. METHODS: Four participants (C4\u20137, AIS A-C) completed 11 sessions of robotic training using a passive robotic exoskeleton (Armeo Spring\u00ae). Descriptive statistics and visual analyses were used for comparing standard occupational therapy and robotic training. Outcome measures included the Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM-III), the Graded Redefined Assessment of Strength Sensibility and Prehension (GRASSP), and a questionnaire. RESULTS: All of the participants exhibited an increase in assessments of upper limb function (GRASSP-total) right side (0.4%\u201361.2%), and all except for one participant (\u22128%) showed an increase on their left side (20.9%\u2013106.2%). Three out of four participants had improvements in ADL function SCIM-III (ranging from 5.6% to 46.7%). Results demonstrated improvements during the robotic intervention period in five out of 28 measurements. The participants enjoyed the exercise, and found it motivating and relevant to their injury (median ranged from 3.5 to 6.5 on a 0\u20137 scale). CONCLUSIONS: Three out of four participants improved upper limb function and ADL independence, but the study could not confirm that improvements were due to the robotic intervention. The participants enjoyed the robotic training and found it relevant to their injury.","output":"A single-subject study of robotic upper limb training in the subacute phase for four persons with cervical spinal cord injury","__index_level_0__":108931}

To our knowledge this has been reported only five times previously. We present the case of a 60-year-old man involved in a motor vehicle accident who suffered an atlantooccipital dislocation and C5-C6 three-column injury. A unique MRI image of a defect in the ventral dura posterior to C2 was appreciated. He underwent occiput to T2 internal fixation and arthrodesis. During surgery, CSF egress was seen caudal to the right C2 nerve root. A DuraMatrix onlay patch reinforced with DuraSeal was placed to stop the CSF leak. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was also placed. The patient made a satisfactory recovery with residual mild weakness of his right upper extremity. In this report, we demonstrate that careful MRI review can reveal a ventral durotomy in a traumatic atlantooccipital dislocation and, if discovered, effective treatment including a lumbar subarachnoid drain for CSF diversion may prevent progression to a retropharyngeal pseudomeningocele.

We established a program of rapid vaccination and evaluation of antibody-mediated response to all EUA COVID-19 vaccines in an inner city minority population to determine the factors that contribute to the poor seroconversion to COVID-19 vaccination in this population. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of 126 patients with hematologic malignancies in the outpatient practices of our institution who completed their vaccination series with one of the three FDA EUA COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson (J&J). We qualitatively measured Spike IgG production in all patients using the AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay and quantitatively in 106 patients who completed their vaccination series with at least 14 days after the 2nd dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or 28d after the single J&J vaccine. Patient characteristics were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and associations between patient characteristics, cancer subtypes, treatments, and vaccine response were assessed using Fisher Exact test or Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test. The majority of patients (74%) were minorities. Seventy patients (60%) received Pfizer, 36 patients (31%) Moderna, and 10 patients (9%) J&J. We observed a high-rate of seropositivity (86%) with 16 pts (14%) having a negative Spike IgG. Of the 86 minority patients included, 94% Blacks (30\/32) and 87% (39\/45) Hispanics showed seropositivity. The factors that contributed to significantly lower seroconversion rates included patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p=0.005), those who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (p=0.002), IVIG (p=0.01), CAR-T cell therapy (p=0.00002), and CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Ab) (p=0.0000008). Plasma cell neoplasms (p=0.02), immunomodulatory agents (p=0.01), and proteasome inhibitors (p=0.01) had significantly higher seroconversion rates, and those with a history of prior COVID-19 (11%, 12\/106) had significantly higher antibody titers (p=0.0003). The positivity rate was 86% (37 seropositive, 6 seronegative) for autologous HSCT and 75% (3 seropositive, 1 seronegative) for allogeneic HSCT. No life-threatening AE were observed. We show high seroconversion rates after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in non-White patients with hematologic malignancies treated with a wide spectrum of therapeutic modalities. Vaccination is safe, effective, and should be encouraged in most patients with hematologic malignancies. Our minorities based study could be employed as an educational tool to dispel myths and provide data driven evidence to overcome vaccine hesitancy.","output":"High Seroconversion Rates Amongst Black and Hispanics With Hematologic Malignancies after SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination","__index_level_0__":104054}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hit Italy early and strongly, challenging the whole health care system. Proctological patients and surgeons are experiencing a previously unseen change in care with unknown repercussion. Here we discuss the proctological experience of 4 Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Following remote brainstorming, the authors summarised their experience in managing proctological patients during the COVID-19 pandemics and put forward some practical observations to further investigate. RESULTS: The 4 hospitals shifted from a high-volume proctological activity to almost \"zero\" visits and surgery. Every patient accessing the hospital must respect a specific COVID-19 protocol. Proctological patients can be stratified based on presentation and management considerations into (1) neoplastic patients, the only allowed to be surgically treated, (2) the ones requiring urgent care, operated only in highly selected cases and (3) the stable, already known patients, managed remotely. Changes in the clinical management of the proctological disease are presented together with some considerations to be explored. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of scientific evidence, these practical considerations may be valuable to proctological surgeons starting to face the COVID-19 pandemics. Beside the more clinical considerations, this crisis produced unexpected consequences such as an improvement of the therapeutic alliance and a shift towards telemedicine that may be worth exploring also in the post-COVID-19 era.","output":"From high volume to \"zero\" proctology: Italian experience in the COVID era","__index_level_0__":87358}

Thus, to provide a well-conceptualized viewpoint demonstrating the prognostic value of thrombocytopenia in COVID-19, we performed a meta-analysis of pertinent literature. METHODS: The keywords \u201cplatelet\u201d OR \u201cthrombocytopenia\u201d AND \u201cCOVID-19\u201d OR \u201ccoronavirus 2019\u201d OR \u201c2019-nCoV\u201d OR \u201cSARS-CoV-2\u201d were searched in National Library of Medicine Medline\/PubMed and Scopus between December 30, 2019, and May 9, 2020 in English without any restriction. The initial search results were first screened by title and abstract, and then full texts of relevant articles representing information on the platelet count (main outcome) with a clinically validated de\ufb01nition of COVID-19 severity were \ufb01nally selected. To assess the existence of bias in the included studies, the funnel plot and egger plot along with egger tests were used. Also, the heterogeneity among the included studies was tested using the Chi-square test. RESULTS: The results of our meta-analysis of 19 studies, totaling 3383 COVID-19 patients with 744 (21.9%) severe cases, revealed that non-severe cases have a significantly higher number of platelets and showed that the probability of the emergence of thrombocytopenia is significantly higher in the severe cases with the pooled mean difference of -21.5 (%95 CI: -31.57, -11.43). CONCLUSION: Decreased number of platelets more commonly associates with severe COVID-19; however, whether the emergence of thrombocytopenia may result in diseases severity or the severity of the disease may decrease platelets, is open to debate.","output":"The Prognostic Value of Thrombocytopenia in COVID-19 Patients; a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","__index_level_0__":77649}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND The Octopus technique is an off-label and off-the-shelf strategy used as an option in the management of some specific and selected cases of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). We sought to compare 2 different methods of measurements on computed tomography (CT) slices and to evaluate the accommodation and conformability, before and after ballooning, of the components used in the Octopus technique. METHODS The CT gutter analysis between the 3 stent grafts within the short docking limb of the Excluder(\u00ae) was made using Viabahns(\u00ae) of 8, 7, and 6 mm in diameter. Each of the 10 possible combinations underwent a CT established protocol. The best axial image of the docking limb was submitted for an evaluation by 2 independent analysts, using 2 different methods. We also performed a postballooning evaluation, and the same CT protocol was used. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the formats of measurement type \"A\" and type \"B.\" Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the measurements made by the independent analysts. The tomography analyses demonstrated that the combination of stent grafts (Viabahn) of 8 and 7 mm diameter, inside the short docking limb of the bifurcated endoprosthesis, had the best possible relationship between the diameters used. These combinations showed better conformability and juxtaposition, with smaller areas of gutters and theoretically less possibility of endoleak. In addition, we found that postimplant balloon dilatation impaired the conformability and juxtaposition of the stent grafts (Viabahn) in the optimum combinations. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, we demonstrated a feasible, reliable, and reproducible form of CT measurement of the gutters in the Octopus technique for endovascular repair of TAAAs. Based on these measurements, there is a preferable combination of Viabahn sizes to be used in the Octopus technique and that postdilatation impairs the conformability and juxtaposition.","output":"Tomographic Measurement of Gutters and Analysis of the Conformability of Stent Grafts in the Octopus Technique for Endovascular Thoracoabdominal Aneurysm Repair.","__index_level_0__":73112}
{"instruction":"what causes bipolar disorder","input":" Bipolar disorder Overview Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). - Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. - Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired - Increased activity, energy or agitation - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) - Decreased need for sleep - Unusual talkativeness - Racing thoughts - Distractibility - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) - Either insomnia or sleeping too much - Either restlessness or slowed behavior - Fatigue or loss of energy - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Causes The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse Complications Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use - Suicide or suicide attempts - Legal or financial problems - Damaged relationships - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders - Eating disorders - Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Alcohol or drug problems - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity Diagnosis To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You'll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it's usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn't work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don't make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you're taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what's going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There's less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child's developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. Lifestyle and home remedies You'll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who's treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you're taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. Alternative medicine There isn't much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn't clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don't stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren't regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications. ","output":"The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as biological or genetic differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder, periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event, or drug or alcohol abuse. Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious personal problems, such as drug and alcohol use, suicide or suicide attempts, legal or financial problems, damaged relationships, or poor work and school performance. If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. These can include anxiety disorders, eating disorders, heart disease, or obesity.","__index_level_0__":61718}

We have additionally developed a defined biochemical assay in which the only protein present is the poliovirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which recapitulates the strand transfer events of the recombination process. We have used both assays to investigate the role of the polymerase fidelity and nucleotide turnover rates in recombination. Our results, of both poliovirus intertypic and intratypic recombination in the CRE-REP assay and using a range of polymerase variants in the biochemical assay, demonstrate that RdRp fidelity is a fundamental determinant of recombination frequency. High fidelity polymerases exhibit reduced recombination and low fidelity polymerases exhibit increased recombination in both assays.

METHODS Patients were identified with active thyroid-associated orbitopathy who were intolerant of or had progression of disease despite systemic corticosteroids and subsequently were treated with tocilizumab between January 2015 and December 2020. Clinical Activity Score, Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels were assessed prior to initiation of tocilizumab, following the first dose, and after the completion of treatment. RESULTS Eleven patients were candidates for and underwent treatment with tocilizumab, 9 of which met criteria for analysis. Average age was 55.6 years. Average time between onset of active thyroid-associated orbitopathy and completion of tocilizumab was 6.5 months. Average number of infusions was 4.2. There was a statistically significant reduction in Clinical Activity Score, Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels when comparing pre-treatment values (mean Clinical Activity Score 6.78 \u00b1 1.09, mean Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score 10.2 \u00b1 1.92, mean thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level 440.6 [%]) to values immediately following completion of treatment (mean Clinical Activity Score 0.44 \u00b1 0.53, mean difference 6.3 points, p < 0.001 [95% CI, 5.5-7.2]; mean Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score 1.2 \u00b1 1.09, mean difference 9.0 points, p < 0.001 [95% CI, 7.2-10.8]; mean thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level 200.7 [%], mean difference 239.9 [%], p = 0.001 [95% CI, 124.3-355.4]). One patient had elevation of cholesterol following therapy induction. Patients were followed for an average of 23.6 months after treatment.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assays are understudied within contexts of low pre-test probability, including screening asymptomatic persons without epidemiological links to confirmed cases, or asymptomatic surveillance testing. SARS-CoV-2 detection without symptoms may represent resolved infection with persistent RNA shedding, presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, or a false positive test. This study assessed clinical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays by retesting positive specimens from five pre-test probability groups ranging from high to low with an alternate assay. Materials and Methods: A total of 122 rRT-PCR positive specimens collected from unique patients between March and July 2020 were retested using a laboratory-developed nested RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene followed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Significantly less positive results in the lowest pre-test probability group (facilities with institution-wide screening having [\u2264]3 positive asymptomatic cases) were reproduced with the nested RdRp gene RT-PCR assay than in all other groups combined (5\/32, 15.6% vs 61\/90, 68%; p <0.0001), and in each subgroup with higher pre-test probability (individual subgroup range 50.0% to 85.0%). Conclusions: A higher proportion of false-positive test results are likely with lower pre-test probability. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results should be interpreted within the context of patient history, clinical setting, known exposure, and estimated community disease prevalence.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Possible links between the transmission of COVID-19 and meteorology have been investigated by comparing positive cases across geographical regions or seasons. Little is known, however, about the degree to which environmental conditions modulate the daily dynamics of COVID-19 spread at a given location. One reason for this is that individual waves of the disease typically rise and decay too sharply, making it hard to isolate the contribution of meteorological cycles. To overcome this shortage, we here present a case study of the first wave of the outbreak in the city of Buenos Aires, which had a slow evolution of the caseload extending along most of 2020. We found that humidity plays a prominent role in modulating the variation of COVID-19 positive cases through a negative-slope linear relationship, with an optimal lag of 9 days between the meteorological observation and the positive case report. This relationship is specific to winter months, when relative humidity predicts up to half of the variance in positive case count. Our results provide a tool to anticipate possible local surges in COVID-19 cases after events of low humidity. More generally, they add to accumulating evidence pointing to dry air as a facilitator of COVID-19 transmission.","output":"Relative Humidity Predicts Day-to-Day Variations in COVID-19 Cases in the City of Buenos Aires.","__index_level_0__":106422}

Methods: We used a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample including 2,687 college students. Data was collected online during the Argentinean quarantine. We calculated one-way between-groups ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. Results: Regionally, the center and the most populated area differed in psychological well-being\/discomfort and negative alcohol-related consequences, but not in the remaining MHS indicators. According to the quarantine sub-periods, there were differences in psychological well-being\/discomfort, social functioning and coping, psychological distress, and negative alcohol-related consequences. Negative alcohol-related consequences were the only MHS indicator improving over time. For all of the remaining MHS indicators, we found a similar deterioration pattern in the course of time, with mean scores decreasing from the first to the 2nd week of the quarantine pre-extensions, then increasing toward the 1st week of the quarantine post-extension (with some MHS indicators reaching mean scores worse than the start), and then continued to increase.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to stark reductions in economic activity in India. We employ CMIE's Consumer Pyramids Household Survey to examine the timing, distribution, and mechanism of the impacts from this shock on income and consumption through December 2020. First, we estimate large and heterogeneous drops in income, with ambiguous effects on inequality. While incomes of salaried workers fell 35%;incomes of daily laborers fell 75%. At the same time, we observe that income fell more for individuals from households in the highest income quartile. Second, we document an increase in effort to buffer income shocks by switching occupations. We employ a Roy Model to estimate the gains from occupation churn and find, surprisingly, that reservation wages fell, implying that the risk of COVID did not reduce the value of employment. Third, we find that consumption fell less than income, suggesting households were able to smooth the idiosyncratic components of the COVID shock as well as they did before COVID. Finally, consumption of food and fuel fell less than consumption of durables such as clothing and appliances. Following Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001), we estimate Engel curves and find that changes in consumption reflect large price shocks (rather than a retreat to subsistence) in sectors other than food and fuel\/power. In the food sector, it appear that lockdown successfully distinguished essential and non-essential services, at least to the extent that it did not increase the relative price of food.

Expression of CD56 has been studied in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with controversial results. The scope of this study was to examine the expression of CD56 in MM patients at diagnosis and investigate its association with clinicopathologic parameters. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from 109 patients with MM diagnosed over the last decade (January 2010 to June 2020). Expression of CD56 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow biopsies and investigated its association with a variety of clinicopathological parameters. For the statistical analysis \u03c72 test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables in CD56+ and CD56- patients, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Based on the expression of CD56 the patient population was divided to CD56+ patients and CD56- patients; Sixty-eight patients were CD56 + and 41 patients were CD56-. Absence of CD56 expression was associated with unfavorable prognostic parameters such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and \u03b22-microglobulin levels, advanced stage according to the International Staging System (ISS) and clonal bone marrow plasma cell infiltration \u2265 60%, but no effect on outcome, while the expression of CD56 was associated with well differentiated neoplastic plasma cells. Our study confirmed that lack of CD56 expression is a possible marker of poor prognosis in patients with MM. The detection of CD56 expression by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry is simple and cheap, and it could be incorporated in future prognostic or predictive scores. Prospective studies are needed in order to evaluate the role of expression of CD56 as a predictive biomarker in the era of novel regimens.","output":"CD56 expression in multiple myeloma: Correlation with poor prognostic markers but no effect on outcome.","__index_level_0__":94714}
{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE Drug shortages are a clear and growing challenge. Prominent shortages included oncology medications and supportive care products essential for the care of patients with cancer. Oncology drug shortages often result in disruptions in the timing of chemotherapy treatments, alterations in the dose or regimen administered, or even missed doses when alternative agents are unavailable. The purpose of this survey was to characterize the impact of oncology drug shortages across the United States, including the experiences of health care organizations, resource implications, and the impact on patient safety, patient care, and clinical trials. METHODS A 36-item online survey was distributed to membership of the Hematology\/Oncology Pharmacy Association to gather information on shortages of oncology drugs (ie, all drugs essential in the care of patients with cancer, including supportive care agents). RESULTS Sixty-eight US organizations participated in the survey between December 2019 and July 2020. Sixty-three percent of institutions reported one or more drug shortages per month, with a 34% increase in 2019 from 2018. Treatment delays, reduced doses, or alternative regimens were reported by 75% of respondents. The most difficult agents to obtain were vincristine, vinblastine, intravenous immunoglobulin, leucovorin, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. CONCLUSION A survey of US oncology pharmacists indicated that oncology drug shortages occurred frequently in 2020. Shortages led to delays in chemotherapy and changes in treatment or omission, complicated clinical research, and increased risk of medication errors and adverse outcomes.","output":"National Survey on the Effect of Oncology Drug Shortages in Clinical Practice: A Hematology Oncology Pharmacy Association Survey.","__index_level_0__":73552}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: COVID-19 catalyzed a rapid and substantial reorganization of primary care, accelerating the spread of existing strategies and fostering a proliferation of innovations. Access to primary care is an essential component of a health care system, particularly during a pandemic. We describe organizational innovations aiming to improve access to primary care and related contextual changes, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in two Canadian provinces, Quebec and Nova Scotia. Methods: We conducted a multiple case studies, based on 63 semi-structured interviews (n=33 in Quebec, n=30 in Nova Scotia) conducted between October 2020 and May 2021 and a review of related internal documents from both jurisdictions. We recruited a diverse range of provincial and regional stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, decision-makers, family physicians, nurses) involved in reorganizing primary care during COVID-19 using purposeful sampling (e.g., based on role, region). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted in NVivo12. Emerging results were discussed by team members to identify salient themes and organized into logic models. Results: We identified and analyzed six organizational innovations. Four of these - centralized public online booking systems, centralized access centers for unattached patients, and interim primary care clinics for unattached patients and community connector to health and social services for older adults \u2013 pre-dated COVID-19 but were accelerated by the pandemic context. The remaining two innovations were created to specifically address pandemic-related needs: COVID-19 hotlines and COVID dedicated primary healthcare clinics. Innovation spread and proliferation was influenced by several factors such as a strengthened sense of community amongst providers, decreased patient demand at the beginning of the first wave, renewed policy and provider interest in population-wide access (versus attachment of patients only), suspended performance targets (e.g., continuity \u226580%) in Quebec, in modality of care delivery, modified fee codes, and greater regional flexibility to implement tailored innovations. Conclusion: COVID-19 accelerated the uptake and creation of organizational innovations to potentially improve access to primary healthcare, removing, at least temporarily, certain longstanding barriers. Many stakeholders believed this reorganization would have positive impacts on access to primary care after COVID-19. Further studies should analyze the effectiveness and sustainability of innovations adapted, developed, and implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.","output":"COVID-19 \u2013 An Opportunity to Improve Access to Primary Care Through Organizational Innovations?","__index_level_0__":90594}
