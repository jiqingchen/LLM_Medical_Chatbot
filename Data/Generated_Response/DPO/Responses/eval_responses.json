{"input":"BACKGROUND The Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke 3 (DEFUSE 3) clinical trial assessed the use of endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) during the period 6-16 hours after last normal in selected patients. This is a secondary cohort analysis of the DEFUSE 3 data assessing potential predictive variables for mortality in the EVT-treated patients. METHODS The primary outcome was death within 90 days. Patients who died and those who did not were compared statistically. We developed a predictive score using preprocedural variables that were statistically predictive of death in univariate regression analysis (P<0.1). RESULTS Of the 182 patients in the DEFUSE 3 study, 92 (mean age 69 years; 50% male) met our inclusion criteria, and 15.2% of these patients met the primary outcome. Patient age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, wake-up stroke, statin use, and history of diabetes were statistically associated with death. Statin use did not improve the prediction score so was excluded. Thus, our model included four predictors, with one point each given for age >75 years, NIHSS \u226520, wake-up stroke, and diabetes, yielding low (0-1), moderate (2), and high (3-4) risk of death. In the low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk categories, 2\/52 (3.9%), 3\/23 (13.0%), and 9\/17 (52.9%) of patients died, respectively (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Despite selective inclusion criteria and overwhelming benefit for EVT, a substantial number of EVT patients in DEFUSE 3 died.

A network crystal is a type of crystal structure in which atoms or molecules are arranged in a three-dimensional network of bonds. In a network crystal, each atom or molecule is bonded to multiple other atoms or molecules, forming a continuous network of bonds throughout the crystal. Silicon carbide is a hard and brittle material that is commonly used in the manufacture of grinding wheels and other abrasive tools. It is a network crystal with a tetrahedral structure, in which each silicon atom is bonded to four carbon atoms."}

{"input":"BACKGROUND: Nursing home (NH) populations have borne the brunt of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. We surveyed Michigan NHs to evaluate preparedness, staffing, testing, and adaptations to these challenges. METHODS: Interpandemic survey responses were collected May 1-12, 2020. We used Pearson's Chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test, and logistic regression to evaluate relationships. RESULTS: Of 452 Michigan NHs contacted via e-mail, 145 (32.1%) opened the survey and of these, 143 (98.6%) responded. Sixty-eight percent of respondents indicated their response plan addressed most issues. NHs reported receiving rapidly changing guidance from many sources. Two-thirds reported shortages of personal protective equipment and other supplies. Half (50%) lacked sufficient testing resources with only 36% able to test residents and staff with suspected COVID-19. A majority (55%) experienced staffing shortages. Sixty-three percent experienced resignations, with front-line clinical staff more likely to resign, particularly in facilities caring for COVID-19 patients (P < .001). Facilities adapted quickly, creating COVID-19 units (78%) to care for patients on site. To reduce isolation, NHs facilitated communication via phone calls (98%), videoconferencing (96%), and window visits (81%). A majority continued to provide requisite therapies (90%). CONCLUSIONS: NHs experienced shortages of resources, testing supplies, and staffing challenges. COVID-19 in the facility was a key predictor of staff resignations.

During the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on oncologists' clinical activity and what changes have been made compared with the Italian situation during the first wave of the pandemic. Overall, 138 heads of medical oncology departments participated in this survey: 75 (54%) from the North, 24 (17%) from the Centre and 39 (28%) from the South of Italy and islands. This survey provides an overview of Italian oncologists facing the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. The lesson learned during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic has led to a better organisation of clinical activities, and regular testing among healthcare practitioners, with better chances to grant patients' protection. However, the lack of standardised informatic platforms results in serious challenges in replacing frontal visits, often making a concrete reduction of patients' hospital accesses unfeasible.

Overall, 70% of the oncologists reported that they had been able to keep the same number of patients under treatment during the second wave, with a significant decrease in the number of new patients treated. The lack of standardised informatic platforms for telemedicine services, and the need of a better organisation of the workforce, are the most important challenges to face.

Angina is a type of chest pain or discomfort that is caused by a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle. Anemia, or a low red blood cell count, can lead to a decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity, which can contribute to the development of angina in individuals with pre-existing coronary artery disease. This is because the heart muscle is already compromised and requires a higher level of oxygen to function properly. When the heart muscle is not receiving enough oxygen, it can become ischemic, leading to chest pain and discomfort. Anemia may also be associated with other cardiovascular symptoms, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and dizziness. It is important to recognize and treat anemia, particularly in individuals with pre-existing coronary artery disease, to prevent potential complications and to improve overall health outcomes. If you are experiencing symptoms of anemia or angina, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. Anemia may be treated with blood transfusions or medications to increase red blood cell production, while angina may be managed with lifestyle changes, medications, or procedures such as stent placement.

{"input":"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has inundated healthcare systems globally especially resources in intensive care units (ICUs). Tracheostomy may be required in critically ill COVID-19 patients to facilitate weaning and to optimize resources like ventilator and ICU beds. Percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT) has become the standard of care globally in ICUs; however, it is considered a high-risk procedure in COVID-19 patients because of the inherent risk of aerosol generation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation because of respiratory failure for \u226510 days were evaluated for PCT. We developed a four-step approach from patient selection and timing, preparation, performance, and postprocedure for PCT in these patients. RESULTS: We evaluated our four-step protocol in four patients. One of them was non-COVID patient and rest three were COVID patients. The procedure was uneventful in all of the patients with median time of procedure and apnea is 10 minutes 30 seconds and 2 minutes 20 seconds, respectively. The tracheostomy was decannulated in two of these patients and one patient is still on ventilator. CONCLUSION: We believe our four-step protocol for PCT in critically ill COVID-19 patient is simple, safe, and easily adapted in any setting with limited training and available resources.

The patient advocacy track at the congress was co-developed with patients, and was integrated into the overall programme. It included four sessions on the financial impact of cancer, treatments that use the body's immune system to fight cancer, technology, and rare cancers. This comes at a time when there is an increasing focus on the value of real-world data (data from a real-life setting, rather than in a clinical trial) and a more active role for patients and patient organisations as partners in research. Challenges and opportunities arising during the COVID-19 pandemic were also discussed, including logistical complexities in healthcare and consequent uncertainty for patients in accessing care, and opportunities including increased use of telemedicine and broader participation offered by virtual\/on-site hybrid congress formats, as used in ESMO 2021. Data discussed on combination treatments for patients with bladder cancer suggest an improved chance of remission for patients intolerant or resistant to existing treatment. Some of the data from studies in kidney cancer also suggest that treatment breaks or longer periods between treatment can improve quality of life and reduce treatment costs, without reducing treatment effectiveness.

The role of perception can be relevant in exploring effects and pollution control actions. The purpose of this study was to explore studies that analyse people's perception, together with the measurement of air pollution, in order to elucidate the relationship between them. We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In March 2020, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were explored in an attempt to search for studies published from 2000 to 2020. The review included 38 studies, most of which were conducted in China (n = 13) and the United States (n = 11) and published over the last four years (n = 26). Three studies were multicenter investigations, while five articles were based on a national-level survey. The air quality (AQ) was assessed by monitoring stations (n = 24) or dispersion models (n = 7). Many studies were population questionnaire-based, air monitoring and time-series studies, and web-based investigations. A direct association between exposure and perception emerged in 20 studies. This systematic review has shown that most of the studies establish a relationship between risk perception measurement. A broad spectrum of concepts and notions related to perception also emerged, which is undoubtedly an indicator of the wealth of available knowledge and is promising for future research.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"input":"Considering the widespread transmission of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) globally, India is also facing the same crisis. As India already has inadequate waste treatment facilities, and the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has led to significant growth of Bio-medical waste (BMW), consequently safe disposal of a large quantity of waste has become a more serious concern. This study provides a comprehensive assessment of BMW of India before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, this article highlights the gaps in the implementation of BMW rules in India. This study uses various government and non-government organizations, reports and data specifically from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). The finding of the study demonstrated that most of the States\/Union Territories (UTs) of India are lacking in terms of COVID-19 waste management. India has generated over 32,996 mt of COVID-19 waste between June and December 2020. During this period, Maharashtra (789.99 mt\/month) is highest average generator of COVID-19 waste, followed by Kerala (459.86 mt\/month), Gujarat (434.87 mt\/month), Tamil Nadu (427.23 mt\/month), Uttar Pradesh (371.39 mt\/month), Delhi (358.83 mt\/month) and West Bengal (303.15 mt\/month), and others respectively. We draw attention to the fact that many gaps were identified with compliance of BMW management rules. For example, out of all 35 States\/UTs, health care facilitates (HCFs), only eight states received authorization as per BMW management rules. Moreover, the government strictly restricted the practice of deep burials; however, 23 States\/UTs are still using the deep burial methods for BMW disposal. The present research suggests that those States\/UTs generated on an average of 100 mt\/month COVID-19 waste in the last 7 months (June-December 2020) should be considered as a high priority state. These states need special attention to implement BMW rules and should upgrade their BMW treatment capacity.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the shape of red blood cells, which can lead to blockages in the blood vessels and increase the risk of stroke. Exchange transfusion is a common treatment for sickle cell disease and can help to reduce the risk of complications.

{"input":"OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the utilization of a mobile multifunctional workstation for COVID-19 sample collection. METHODS: Twenty-four nurses and 150 individuals who took nucleic acid tests using mobile multifunctional workstations in Beijing Youan Hospital, Capital Medical University, from September to November 2020, were enrolled in the study as the observation group. As the control group, we included 36 nurses and 150 individuals who did not use the workstations from June to September 2020. We compared the two groups on (1) comfort of working environment, self-perceived security, the convenience of information system, operational process flexibility, pharyngeal acquisition visibility, and effectiveness of communication among nurses; and (2) self-perceived safety, waiting time, and overall satisfaction among individuals who took nucleic acid tests. RESULTS: The satisfaction score of nurses in the observation group of nurses were significantly higher than those of the control group (OR = 17.297 95% CI:4.294, 69.673), as well as the convenience of the information system (OR = 6.250 95% CI: 1.775, 22.008), and communication effectiveness (OR = 5.588 95% CI: 1.590, 19.646).

{"input":"AIMS\/INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to reveal lifestyle changes and their impact on glycemic control and weight control in patients with diabetes during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 1,402 outpatients with diabetes at a clinic in Osaka, Japan, who responded to an interview sheet regarding lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic between 28 March and 30 May 2020. The association of lifestyle changes with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight changes from February to May 2020 was investigated using the linear regression model. We also investigated the association with clinically important change of HbA1c (by &#8805;0.3%) and bodyweight (by &#8805;3%), using the cumulative link model. RESULTS: Leisure time and other outside physical activities were decreased in one-quarter of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the amount of meals and snacks was decreased and increased in approximately 10%, respectively. The change in leisure time physical activities was inversely associated with HbA1c and weight changes, whereas the quantitative change of meals with the decline in eating out and that of snacks were positively associated with HbA1c and weight changes (all P < 0.05). The quantitative change of meals without the decline in eating out was also positively associated with weight change (P = 0.012). The cumulative link model for clinically important HbA1c and weight change showed broadly similar associations, except for that between snacks and bodyweight (P = 0.15). CONCLUSIONS: A considerable number of outpatients with diabetes experienced lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Low-dose TTT is not recommended as a first-line treatment for neovascular AMD. Ranibizumab is a more effective and safer option for all types of neovascular AMD. PDT is also not recommended as a first-line treatment for neovascular AMD, as it has not been shown to be as effective as ranibizumab. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment options for neovascular AMD. Treatment may vary depending on the severity of the disease and the individual's medical history.  Additionally, the risk of adverse effects should also be considered when choosing a treatment option.  The goal of treatment for neovascular AMD is to reduce the risk of vision loss and preserve vision as much as possible.  In summary, ranibizumab is the preferred first-line treatment for neovascular AMD, with PDT and low-dose TTT being less effective and potentially risky alternatives.

The use of an ACE inhibitor and a statin did not change the albumin-to-creatinine ratio over time. The albumin-to-creatinine ratio is a measure of the amount of albumin and creatinine in the urine. It is used to diagnose and monitor kidney disease. The use of an ACE inhibitor and a statin may not have an effect on the albumin-to-creatinine ratio because these medications do not directly affect the kidneys. However, other medications or treatments may be more effective in managing kidney disease and improving the albumin-to-creatinine ratio. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized advice and treatment. In general, it is recommended to maintain a healthy diet, exercise regularly, and manage other medical conditions such as hypertension and diabetes to reduce the risk of kidney disease and other health problems. If you have any concerns about your kidney health, it is best to talk to your doctor or a healthcare professional. They can help you understand your risk factors and develop a plan to manage your kidney health. Thank you for using chatbot. We hope this advice was helpful.

When PTH is secreted, it binds to receptors on the surface of the proximal tubule cells and activates signaling pathways that lead to the excretion of phosphate. This process helps to regulate the levels of phosphate in the blood and prevent the development of hypophosphatemia. It is important to maintain normal phosphate levels in the body, as they are essential for the proper functioning of many organs and tissues, including the bones, muscles, and nervous system. However, excessive or prolonged PTH secretion can lead to the development of hyperphosphatemia, which can have serious health consequences. Therefore, it is important to monitor PTH levels and take appropriate measures to prevent or treat any abnormalities."}

This enzyme is a key player in the regulation of blood sugar levels in the body. Glucose-6-phosphate is a phosphorylated form of glucose that is produced during the breakdown of carbohydrates in the body. Phosphoglucomutase catalyzes the conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to glucose, which is then used as a source of energy for various cells and tissues in the body. A deficiency in phosphoglucomutase can lead to a condition called glycogen storage disease, which can cause a buildup of glucose in the liver and other tissues, leading to a range of symptoms including muscle weakness, fatigue, and an increased risk of infections. Phosphoglucomutase is an important enzyme in the regulation of blood sugar levels, and its activity can be affected by various factors such as diet, exercise, and medication. It is important to maintain a healthy balance of glucose in the body to prevent complications such as diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Understanding the role of phosphoglucomutase in the regulation of blood sugar levels can help individuals make informed decisions about their health and wellness."}

This meta\u2010analysis was conducted to assess the effect of age of COVID\u201019 inpatient on the severity of the disease. METHODS: A systematic literature search up to January 2021 was performed and 5 studies included 910 inpatients with COVID\u201019 disease at the baseline of the study; 773 of them were adult inpatients, and 137 of them were paediatric inpatients.

Odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated assessing the effect of age of COVID\u201019 inpatient on the severity of the disease using the dichotomous method with a random or fixed\u2010effect model. RESULTS: Adults with COVID\u201019 disease had significantly lower number of mild cases (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.04\u20100.77, P = .02); higher number severe cases (OR, 4.90; 95% CI, 2.03\u201011.83, P < .001); higher number of cases with fever (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 2.31\u20107.43, P < .001); and higher number of cases with CT positive COVID\u201019 disease (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.17\u20103.55, P = .001) compared with children.

{"input":"OBJECTIVE: Telehealth is a timely solution for delivering health care during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The practice of endocrinology is suited to provide virtual care to patients with a variety of endocrine disorders. In this survey, we aimed to gauge the adoption of telehealth practices during the COVID-19 pandemic among endocrinologists in the United States (U.S.). METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, online survey-based study. Members of the Facebook group \"Endocrinologists\" were invited to participate in the survey. Characteristics of respondents and their rates of adoption of telehealth were described and analyzed for statistically significant associations using the Pearson chi-square test. RESULTS: A total of 181 physicians responded to the survey. The majority of respondents were females (75%), younger than or equal to 40 years of age (51%), employed (72%) either by a private group\/hospital or by an academic setting, worked in an urban area (88.4%), and were adult endocrinologists (93%). With the COVID-19 outbreak, more than two-fifths (44.2%) of participants switched to completely virtual visits, and an additional 44.2% switched to a majority of virtual visits, with some in-person visits in the outpatient setting. Additionally, there was a significantly higher adoption rate of telehealth among endocrinologists younger than or equal to 40 years of age (P = .02) and among those who practiced in northeastern, midwestern, and the western geographic regions of the U.S. (P = .04).

{"input":"BACKGROUND: A novel coronavirus has caused an international outbreak. Currently, there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a potentially effective treatment option. METHODS: Patients who had recovered from COVID\u201019 and had been discharged from the hospital for more than two weeks were recruited. COVID\u201019 convalescent plasma (CCP)\u2010specific donor screening and selection were performed based the following criteria: 1) aged 18\u201055 years; 2) eligible for blood donation; 3) diagnosed with COVID\u201019; 4) had two consecutive negative COVID\u201019 nasopharyngeal swab tests based on PCR (at least 24 h apart) prior to hospital discharge; 5) had been discharged from the hospital for more than 2 weeks; and 6) had no COVID\u201019 symptoms prior to convalescent plasma donation. In addition, preference was given to CCP donors who had a fever lasting more than 3 days or a body temperature exceeding 38.5 Celsius, and 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms. CCP collection was performed using routine plasma collection procedures via plasmapheresis. In addition to routine donor testing, the CCP donors\u2019 plasma was also tested for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 nucleic acid and S\u2010RBD\u2010specific IgG antibody. RESULTS: Of the 81 potential CCP donors, 64 (79%) plasma products were collected. There were 18 female donors and 46 male donors. There were 34 first\u2010time blood donors and 30 repeat donors. The average time between CCP collection and initial symptom onset was 49.1 days, and the average time between CCP collection and hospital discharge was 38.7 days. The average volume of CCP collected was 327.7 ml. All Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) testing results met blood donation requirements. HIV Ag\/Ab, anti\u2010HCV, anti\u2010syphilis and HBsAg were all negative; NAT for HIV, HBV, and HCV were also negative. In addition, all of the CCP donors\u2019 plasma units were negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 RNA. Of the total 64 CCP donors tested, only one had an S\u2010RBD\u2010specific IgG titer of 1:160, all others had a titer of \u22651:320. CONCLUSION: Based on a feasibility study of a pilot CCP program in Wuhan China, we demonstrated the success and feasibility of CCP collection. In addition, all of the CCP units collected had a titer of \u2265 1:160 for S\u2010RBD\u2010specific IgG antibody, which met the CCP quality control requirements based on the Chinese national guidelines for CCP.

{"input":"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to millions of infections and hundreds of thousands of human deaths. The efficient replication and population spread of SARS-CoV-2 indicates an effective evasion of human innate immune responses, although the viral proteins responsible for this immune evasion are not clear. In this study, we identified SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins, accessory proteins, and the main viral protease as potent inhibitors of host innate immune responses of distinct pathways. In particular, the main viral protease was a potent inhibitor of both the RLR and cGAS-STING pathways. Viral accessory protein ORF3a had the unique ability to inhibit STING, but not the RLR response. On the other hand, structural protein N was a unique RLR inhibitor. ORF3a bound STING in a unique fashion and blocked the nuclear accumulation of p65 to inhibit nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling. 3CL of SARS-CoV-2 inhibited K63-ubiquitin modification of STING to disrupt the assembly of the STING functional complex and downstream signaling. Diverse vertebrate STINGs, including those from humans, mice, and chickens, could be inhibited by ORF3a and 3CL of SARS-CoV-2. The existence of more effective innate immune suppressors in pathogenic coronaviruses may allow them to replicate more efficiently in vivo.

It is calculated by subtracting the incidence of the disease or condition in the control group from the incidence in the intervention group, and then dividing the difference by the incidence in the control group. For example, if the incidence of a disease is 5% in the control group and 3% in the intervention group, the absolute risk reduction would be (5%-3%)\/5% = 40%. This means that the intervention has reduced the incidence of the disease by 40% compared to the control group. Absolute risk reduction is an important measure of the effectiveness of an intervention in reducing the incidence of a disease or condition. It can be used to compare different interventions and to evaluate the potential benefits of implementing a new intervention. Absolute risk reduction is often reported along with relative risk reduction, which is the percentage change in the risk of a disease or condition after an intervention, but it is important to note that these two measures are not interchangeable and should not be used interchangeably. Absolute risk reduction is more directly related to the actual reduction in the incidence of a disease or condition, while relative risk reduction is a more abstract measure that can be affected by changes in the"}

The patient has a history of osteoporosis and has fallen on her outstretched hand, which can lead to fractures of the distal radius and ulna. The patient also has decreased sensation to light touch along the palmar medial 2 digits, which is consistent with damage to the distal median nerve. The distal median nerve supplies the palmar aspect of the lateral 3 digits, which is why sensation to light touch is normal throughout the palm and in the lateral 3 digits. When the patient extends all of her fingers, her 4th and 5th fingers are hyperextended at the MCP joints and flexed at the IP joints, which is consistent with damage to the distal median nerve. The distal median nerve supplies the muscles that flex the MCP joints and extend the IP joints. In contrast, the distal ulnar nerve supplies the muscles that flex the IP joints and extend the MCP joints. Therefore, a patient with damage to the distal ulnar nerve would have the opposite pattern of hyperextension at the MCP joints and flexion at the IP joints.

The decreased TIBC is seen with an iron deficiency, and the increased ferritin is due to the release of iron from the iron stores. The microcytic anemia is also due to the decreased iron available for hemoglobin production. The patient\u2019s anemia is likely due to her fibroids, which have caused heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeds. Treatment should include iron supplementation and correction of any underlying causes of the anemia. In this case, the fibroids should be treated to decrease the amount of blood lost during menstrual bleeding. Iron supplementation may be necessary to help correct the anemia. It is important to rule out other causes of anemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, before starting treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of anemia can help prevent complications such as fatigue, weakness, and difficulty breathing. Patients should be monitored for any signs of complications and should be educated about the importance of following a healthy diet and lifestyle. In some cases, additional testing or treatment may be necessary to help correct the anemia. It is important to follow up with the patient regularly to ensure that the anemia is being effectively treated."}

Acute appendicitis is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms, including intermittent abdominal pain, vomiting, and tenderness on abdominal examination, are classic for appendicitis. The abdominal ultrasound finding of concentric rings of bowel in transverse section is also consistent with this diagnosis. In addition, the patient's elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and elevated platelet count are also indicative of an inflammatory condition, such as appendicitis. Other possible diagnoses, such as intestinal adhesions, Meckel diverticulum, or malrotation with volvulus, are less likely given the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Intestinal polyps are also less likely, as they would not cause the patient's abdominal pain and vomiting. In conclusion, the most likely underlying cause of this patient's condition is acute appendicitis. The patient should be evaluated further with additional diagnostic tests, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment."}

{"input":"OBJECTIVE Sleeping less or more than the 7-8 h has been associated with mortality in the general population, which encompasses diversity in employment status, age and community settings. Since sleep patterns of employed individuals may differ to those of their unemployed counterparts, the nature of their sleep-mortality relationship may vary. We therefore investigated the association between self-reported sleep duration and all-cause mortality (ACM) or cardiovascular disease mortality (CVDM) in employed individuals. DATA SOURCES Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, searches between January 1990 and May 2020 were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Inclusion\/exclusion criteria: Included were prospective cohort studies of 18-64-year-old disease-free employed persons with sleep duration measured at baseline, and cause of death recorded prospectively as the outcome. Gray literature, case-control or intervention design studies were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION Characteristics of the studies, participants, and study outcomes were extracted. The quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. DATA SYNTHESIS The pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained with a random-effects model and results presented as forest plots. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis were assessed. RESULTS Shorter sleep duration (\u22646 h) was associated with a higher risk for (ACM) (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11 -1.22) and CVDM (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.12 -1.41) compared to 7-8 h of sleep, with no significant heterogeneity.

Since sleep patterns of employed individuals may differ to those of their unemployed counterparts, the nature of their sleep-mortality relationship may vary. We therefore investigated the association between self-reported sleep duration and all-cause mortality (ACM) or cardiovascular disease mortality (CVDM) in employed individuals. DATA SOURCES Based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, searches between January 1990 and May 2020 were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Inclusion\/exclusion criteria: Included were prospective cohort studies of 18-64-year-old disease-free employed persons with sleep duration measured at baseline, and cause of death recorded prospectively as the outcome. Gray literature, case-control or intervention design studies were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION Characteristics of the studies, participants, and study outcomes were extracted. The quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. DATA SYNTHESIS The pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained with a random-effects model and results presented as forest plots. Heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis were assessed. RESULTS Shorter sleep duration (\u22646 h) was associated with a higher risk for (ACM) (RR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.11 -1.22) and CVDM (RR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.12 -1.41) compared to 7-8 h of sleep, with no significant heterogeneity. The association between longer sleep (\u22658 h) and ACM (RR: 1.18, 95% CI:1.12 -1.23, P < 0.001) needs to be interpreted cautiously owing to high heterogeneity (I2 = 86.0%, P < 0.001).

{"input":"The current COVID-19 pandemic has generated a series of changes in the daily routines of people, including children and teenagers, in an unprecedented way, which constitutes a global challenge in public health. Social isolation has been a prophylactic measure to prevent the spread of the virus; however, it has generated negative impacts on the physical and emotional health of parents, caregivers, children and teenagers around the world. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of confinement caused by the COVID-19 pandemic at the level of nutritional status, dietary and behavioural patterns of elementary school children and teenagers in a small town of Colombia. Anthropometric parameters such as BMI Z-score, waist circumference and waist\/height ratio were evaluated in 266 school children and teenagers. A questionnaire with socio-demographic, clinical and lifestyle characteristics and the KIDMED were applied to learn about nutritional aspects. A total of 102 students (38\u22c53 %) were classified as having altered nutritional status, being 39 (14\u22c57 %) classified as overweight and 36 (13\u22c55 %) with obesity. The prevalence of high adherence to the Mediterranean diet was 12 %, 95 % CI (0\u22c508, 0\u22c516). Overweight was more prevalent in women (26\/39, 66\u22c57 %; P = 0\u22c50439), and obesity was discreetly more frequent in men (19\/36, 52\u22c57 %; P = 0\u22c57193).

During this stage of cell division, the sister chromatids of chromosome 23 fail to separate and are incorporated into a single gamete. This results in a zygote with three copies of chromosome 23, which is the 47, XXX karyotype. The error in cell division is due to the failure of the sister chromatids to separate, which is a common cause of nondisjunction. Other possible causes of nondisjunction include errors in chromosome segregation during meiosis or errors in the mitotic divisions of the early embryo.

This is because Na+ and Cl- are normally reabsorbed together in the kidneys, and when Cl- secretion is decreased, the reabsorption of Na+ is also affected. In cystic fibrosis, the decreased Cl- secretion is caused by a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which leads to increased Na+ reabsorption and subsequent fluid retention in the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. This can lead to serious health complications, including respiratory distress, pancreatic insufficiency, and other organ dysfunction. Early diagnosis and treatment of cystic fibrosis are crucial to prevent or manage these complications and improve quality of life."}

This form of Rubella occurs when a pregnant woman contracts the virus and passes it on to her unborn child, resulting in a variety of complications, including arthritis. The congenital form of Rubella is a serious condition that can cause a range of symptoms, including joint pain and swelling. It is important for pregnant women to be vaccinated against Rubella to prevent the spread of the virus and to protect their unborn children. If you are pregnant and have not been vaccinated against Rubella, you should consult with your healthcare provider to determine if you need to receive the vaccine. Early diagnosis and treatment of Rubella can help prevent complications and improve outcomes for both mother and child. It is also important to note that the congenital form of Rubella can have long-term effects, including developmental delays, hearing loss, and vision problems. If you are pregnant and suspect that you may have been exposed to Rubella, you should contact your healthcare provider immediately. They can provide you with guidance on how to manage the risk and ensure the health and well-being of your unborn child. In addition to vaccination, there are other measures that can be taken to prevent the spread of Rubella, such as avoiding contact with infected individuals and practicing good"}

However, its use can sometimes lead to a condition called pseudomembranous colitis. This condition is a type of inflammation of the colon that can be caused by the use of certain antibiotics, including Clindamycin. Pseudomembranous colitis is a potentially serious complication that can occur when the normal bacteria that live in the gut are killed off by the antibiotic, allowing other bacteria to overgrow and cause inflammation. Symptoms of pseudomembranous colitis can include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. If left untreated, this condition can lead to sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and complications associated with the use of Clindamycin and other antibiotics, and to consult with a healthcare professional before starting treatment.  If you have any concerns or questions about the use of antibiotics or the potential risks and complications associated with their use, please contact your healthcare provider.

{"input":"Introduction: The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of using potential drugs: remdesivir and glucocorticoid in treating children and adolescents with COVID-19 and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in treating MIS-C. Methods: We searched seven databases, three preprint platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google from December 1, 2019, to August 5, 2021, to collect evidence of remdesivir, glucocorticoid, and IVIG which were used in children and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C. Results: A total of six cohort studies and one case series study were included in this systematic review. In terms of remdesivir, the meta-analysis of single-arm cohort studies have shown that, after the treatment, 37.1% (95%CI, 0.0% to 74.5%) experienced adverse events, 5.9% (95%CI, 1.5% to 10.2%) died, 37.2% (95%CI, 0% to 76.0%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or invasive mechanical ventilation. As for glucocorticoids, the results of the meta-analysis showed that the fixed-effect summary odds ratio for the association with mortality was 2.79 (95%CI, 0.13 to 60.87), and the mechanical ventilation rate was 3.12 (95%CI, 0.80 to 12.08) for glucocorticoids compared with the control group. In terms of IVIG, the two included cohort studies showed that for MIS-C patients with more severe clinical symptoms, IVIG combined with methylprednisolone could achieve better clinical efficacy than IVIG alone. Conclusions: Overall, the current evidence in the included studies is insignificant and of low quality. It is recommended to conduct high-quality randomized controlled trials of remdesivir, glucocorticoids, and IVIG in children and adolescents with COVID-19 or MIS-C to provide substantial evidence for the development of guidelines.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

During the first week of embryonic development, the branchial arches form, which are a series of structures that run from the back of the head to the neck. As the arches develop, they form clefts that are responsible for the development of various structures, including the ears, eyes, and mouth. The branchial arches also give rise to the branchial clefts, which are a series of small pouches that develop along the sides of the embryo. The branchial clefts are important for the development of the head, neck, and face, as they provide a source of cells and tissues that will eventually form these structures. However, if the branchial clefts do not develop properly, it can lead to a range of developmental abnormalities, including cleft lip and palate, and other facial deformities. Therefore, it is important to monitor the development of the branchial clefts during embryonic development to ensure that they are developing properly. By understanding the role of the branchial clefts in embryonic development, researchers can develop better methods for preventing and treating"}

{"input":"INTRODUCTION: Community pharmacists and their teams have remained accessible to the public providing essential services despite immense pressures during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have successfully expanded the influenza vaccination programme and are now supporting the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccination roll-out. AIM: This rapid realist review aims to understand how community pharmacy can most effectively deliver essential and advanced services, with a focus on vaccination, during the pandemic and in the future. METHOD: An embryonic programme theory was generated using four diverse and complementary documents along with the expertise of the project team. Academic databases, preprint services and grey literature were searched and screened for documents meeting our inclusion criteria. The data were extracted from 103 documents to develop and refine a programme theory using a realist logic of analysis. Our analysis generated 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations explaining when, why and how community pharmacy can support public health vaccination campaigns, maintain essential services during pandemics and capitalise on opportunities for expanded, sustainable public health service roles. The views of stakeholders including pharmacy users, pharmacists, pharmacy teams and other healthcare professionals were sought throughout to refine the 13 explanatory configurations. RESULTS: The 13 context-mechanism-outcome configurations are organised according to decision makers, community pharmacy teams and community pharmacy users as key actors. Review findings include: supporting a clear role for community pharmacies in public health; clarifying pharmacists' legal and professional liabilities; involving pharmacy teams in service specification design; providing suitable guidance, adequate compensation and resources; and leveraging accessible, convenient locations of community pharmacy. DISCUSSION: Community pharmacy has been able to offer key services during the pandemic. Decision makers must endorse, articulate and support a clear public health role for community pharmacy. We provide key recommendations for decision makers to optimise such a role during these unprecedented times and in the future.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Tetanus is a bacterial infection that can cause muscle spasms, especially in the jaw and neck. The bacteria that cause tetanus, Clostridium tetani, are found in soil and feces. When a person is exposed to the bacteria, they may become infected if the bacteria enter the body through a wound. The bacteria release toxins that can cause the muscles to contract and spasm. This can lead to severe symptoms, including difficulty breathing, seizures, and even death. Treatment for tetanus typically involves antibiotics to kill the bacteria and medications to control the muscle spasms. Prevention is key to avoiding tetanus, and the best way to prevent it is to get vaccinated against it. Tetanus vaccines are available and are recommended for all adults and children. By getting vaccinated, you can protect yourself from the potentially deadly effects of this disease. If you have been exposed to tetanus or are experiencing symptoms, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. Tetanus can be fatal if left untreated, so it is important to get the appropriate care as soon as possible. By understanding the symptoms and risks of tetanus, you can take steps to prevent and treat this dangerous disease. Tetanus is a serious disease that can cause muscle spas"}

The patient's history of abdominal discomfort, cramping, diarrhea, and the presence of an abscess in the rectum are suggestive of ulcerative colitis. The elevated white blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's family history of wheat allergy is also a risk factor for ulcerative colitis. Laxative abuse and celiac disease are unlikely based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion in this case, as it does not typically involve the presence of an abscess. Crohn's disease is another possibility, but the absence of intestinal bleeding makes it less likely in this case. The differential diagnosis for this patient's symptoms includes ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. The presence of an abscess in the rectum, along with the patient's history and physical examination findings, is most consistent with ulcerative colitis. Additional testing such as endoscopy or biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of treatment."}

Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that can cause pain, stiffness, and difficulty in movement. The symptoms of osteoarthritis can vary, but may include joint pain, stiffness, and difficulty in movement. The pain may be worse in the evening and with activity, as the patient described. Other symptoms of osteoarthritis may include a grating or cracking sound when moving the joint, swelling, and a decreased range of motion. It is important to consult a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment, as osteoarthritis can be managed through a combination of lifestyle changes, medication, and physical therapy. Treatment may include pain relief medication, physical therapy, and the use of assistive devices such as canes or crutches to help with mobility. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the affected joint. Osteoarthritis is a common condition that can affect people of any age, but is more common in older adults. It is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms of osteoarthritis, as early diagnosis and treatment can help to manage the condition and improve quality of life.

Methods An online survey among contact lens educators (educator members of the International Association of Contact Lens Educators), conducted in May 2020. Results A total of 214 responses were received from 32 countries (representing a 39% response rate). Overall, 71% of respondents\u2019 institutions were closed to students to attend at that time. A majority (58%) were delivering more online education than they would normally provide. Live online lectures and discussion was the most commonly used method (68%). Zoom was the most common videoconferencing technology (56%) and the most popular social media platform for communicating with students was WhatsApp (48%). About half (54%) were running online exams or assessments, 24% holding these for students to attend in person, and 27% were conducting practical sessions. Two in three (68%) said they would conduct more than 50% of their total teaching online by the end of 2020, and 12% anticipated 90% or more of their teaching would be online.

This syndrome is a rare condition that can cause inflammation and damage to various organs in the body, including the lungs and kidneys. The exact cause of Churg-Strauss syndrome is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to an allergic reaction to a substance in the environment. Symptoms of this condition can include difficulty breathing, coughing, wheezing, and fluid buildup in the lungs. In severe cases, Churg-Strauss syndrome can lead to organ failure and even death. Treatment typically involves the use of medications to control the symptoms and prevent further damage to the organs. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to managing this condition effectively. If you are experiencing symptoms of Churg-Strauss syndrome, it is important to seek medical attention promptly. Your healthcare provider can perform tests to determine if you have this condition and recommend appropriate treatment options. With proper management, most people with Churg-Strauss syndrome can lead healthy and productive lives. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks and complications associated with this condition and to take steps to prevent or manage them.

{"input":"BACKGROUND: Italy was the first western country to experience a large Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and the province of Bergamo experienced one of the deadliest COVID-19 outbreaks in the world. Following the peak of the epidemic in mid-March, the curve has slowly fallen thanks to the strict lockdown imposed by the Italian government on 9th March 2020. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in 423 workers in Bergamo province who returned to the workplace after the end of the Italian lockdown on 5th May 2020. To this end, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect the humoral response against SARS-CoV-2 and a nasopharyngeal swab to assess the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). As a secondary aim of the study, we validated a lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. FINDINGS: ELISA identified 38.5% positive subjects, of whom 51.5% were positive for both IgG and IgM, 47.3% were positive only for IgG, but only 1.2% were positive for IgM alone. Only 23 (5.4%) participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR, although with high cycle thresholds (between 34 and 39), indicating a very low residual viral load that was not able to infect cultured cells. All these rRT-PCR positive subjects had already experienced seroconversion. When the ELISA was used as the comparator, the estimated specificity and sensitivity of the rapid LFIA for IgG were 98% and 92%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the province of Bergamo reached 38.5%, significantly higher than has been reported for most other regions worldwide. Few nasopharyngeal swabs tested positive in fully recovered subjects, though with a very low SARS-CoV-2 viral load, with implications for infectivity and discharge policies for positive individuals in the post-pandemic period. The rapid LFIA used in this study is a valuable tool for rapid serologic surveillance of COVID-19 for population studies. FUNDING: The study was supported by Regione Lombardia, Milano Serravalle - Milano Tangenziali S.p.A., Brembo S.p.A, and by MEI System.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The diagnosis of HCC is based on the presence of characteristic findings on biopsy.

Therefore, a biopsy may still be necessary to confirm the diagnosis in some cases. In any case, the patient should be evaluated for treatment options, which may include surgical resection, ablation, or systemic therapy.

Iron deficiency anemia can lead to fatigue, weakness, and impaired cognitive function. Complications of iron deficiency anemia can include anemia-related complications such as heart failure and anemia-related infections. The outcome of iron deficiency anemia is generally good, with the majority of patients experiencing a complete recovery with appropriate treatment. However, in some cases, iron deficiency anemia can lead to serious complications such as anemia-related infections or anemia-related heart failure. It is important to identify and treat iron deficiency anemia early to prevent these complications. Regular screening for iron deficiency anemia, especially in high-risk populations such as pregnant women and children, is essential to ensure early detection and appropriate treatment. In summary, the natural progression of iron deficiency anemia is a decline in iron stores, followed by a decline in hemoglobin concentration.

{"input":"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers around the world are experiencing skin injury due to the extended use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These injuries are the result of high shear stresses acting on the skin, caused by friction with the PPE. This study aims to provide a practical lubricating solution for frontline medical staff working a 4+ hours shift wearing PPE. METHODS: A literature review into skin friction and skin lubrication was conducted to identify products and substances that can reduce friction. We evaluated the lubricating performance of commercially available products in vivo using a custom-built tribometer. FINDINGS: Most lubricants provide a strong initial friction reduction, but only few products provide lubrication that lasts for four hours. The response of skin to friction is a complex interplay between the lubricating properties and durability of the film deposited on the surface and the response of skin to the lubricating substance, which include epidermal absorption, occlusion, and water retention. INTERPRETATION: Talcum powder, a petrolatum-lanolin mixture, and a coconut oil-cocoa butter-beeswax mixture showed excellent long-lasting low friction. Moisturising the skin results in excessive friction, and the use of products that are aimed at \u2018moisturising without leaving a non-greasy feel\u2019 should be prevented.

{"input":"INTRODUCTION: Telemedicine has bridged the distance gap between patients and pediatric urologists for over a decade, yet many pediatric urologists have not embraced it as a major part of their practice. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate and clarify the optimal role of telemedicine in pediatric urology, as well as the benefits, barriers, risks, and other important considerations that must be accounted for in its optimal adoption. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, this systematic review utilized Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to search PubMed through April 29, 2021 as follows: (Humans [MeSH]) AND ((Child [MeSH]) OR (Infant [MeSH])) AND ((Remote Consultation [MAJR]) OR (Telemedicine [MAJR]) OR (Videoconferencing [MAJR]) OR (Health Services Accessibility [MAJR])) AND ((Urology [MAJR]) OR (Postoperative Care [MAJR]) OR (Urologic Surgical Procedures [MAJR])). 73 resulting articles, plus 21 from manual searches (e.g. papers too recent to have MeSH terms), were screened. 17 met inclusion criteria by discussing telemedicine in context of pediatric urology in a full manuscript. Non-complete manuscripts and papers not specifically considering pediatric urology, or in which telemedicine was not a major focus, were excluded. RESULTS: 17 papers met inclusion criteria. Varied approaches to the topic included surveys, controlled studies, retrospective studies, and descriptive opinion pieces. Quality of evidence varied, representing at least 1851 virtual encounters, 409 in-person encounters, and 68 clinician opinions. Four papers included a comparison or control group, and none utilized randomization. All 17 papers support expanded application of telemedicine in pediatric urology with varied evidence that telemedicine improves patient access to pediatric urologic care, satisfies both patient families and clinicians, is safe, provides equivalent outcomes, and is practicable.

{"input":"Aichi virus (AiV), a member of the genus Kobuvirus in the family Picornaviridae, causes gastroenteritis in humans. It was noted that AiV differs from other picornaviruses in its unusually high C content and a very high degree of genome-ordered RNA secondary structures. However, the genetic variability and mutational restrictions on a full-genome scale have not been studied. In addition to the available five complete AiV genomes, we determined here another five complete coding sequences of AiV sampled in Germany, 2004. Distinctive AiV genetic features included a low incidence of recombination along the genome without obvious hotspots or spared regions and very low rates of synonymous and non-synonymous variation, supporting an absence of AiV serotypes. In addition, the absence of recombination between AiV genotypes A and B suggested the existence of reproductive isolation between taxonomic units below the species level. In contrast to most other picornaviruses, AiV genomes strongly avoided the UpA dinucleotide, while there was no obvious selection against the CpG dinucleotide. AiV genomes also appeared to contain a codon usage bias (CUB) apparent as an effective number of codons of 39.5, which was amongst the most extreme among RNA viruses. A set of sequence scrambling algorithms was developed to determine the origin of CUB in AiV. While in most picornaviruses the genomic dinucleotide content contributed significantly to CUB, in AiV its extreme nucleotide content, i.e. 57 % third codon position C, was the main driving force behind the apparent CUB.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The ionic radius of Rb+ is 1.48 \u00c5, while the ionic radius of K+ is 1.38 \u00c5, Ca2+ is 0.99 \u00c5, and Sc3+ is 0.64 \u00c5. The trend in ionic radii is as follows: Alkali metals > Alkaline earth metals > Transition metals > Lanthanides. This trend is due to the increasing number of electrons in the valence shell, which results in a greater repulsive force between the electrons and the nucleus. The smaller the radius of an ion, the more stable it is, as it has a higher charge density and is more likely to form stable chemical bonds. Therefore, Rb+ is the smallest ion of the given options. However, it is important to note that the size of an ion can also be affected by the presence of other ions in the solution, as well as the temperature and pressure of the system. Therefore, the exact size of an ion can vary depending on the specific conditions. In general, the trend in ionic radii can be used to predict the properties of a compound, such as its solubility and reactivity. However, it is"}

As a result, they develop female characteristics, such as a uterus and breasts, but have male chromosomes. This can lead to confusion about gender identity, as people with this condition may not identify as either male or female. Treatment may involve hormones to promote development of male or female characteristics, depending on the individual's gender identity. It is important to note that this condition is rare and not all people with a Y chromosome will have Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome. However, it is important to be aware of this condition and to seek medical attention if you have concerns about your gender identity or development.

Lichen sclerosus is a chronic inflammatory disease that can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if left untreated. The ulcerated nodule on the right labium majus and the dry, thin, white lesions encircling the genital and perianal areas are typical features of squamous cell carcinoma. Other potential diagnoses include Bartholin gland cyst or carcinoma, which may present with similar symptoms but typically occur in younger women who are sexually active. Vulvar Paget's disease and melanoma are less likely diagnoses in this patient's age group. The appropriate management for this patient would be to undergo a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the stage of the disease. Treatment options may include surgical excision, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. It is important to recognize the potential for squamous cell carcinoma in patients with lichen sclerosus and to provide appropriate management to prevent the progression of the disease."}

{"input":"Objective In this retrospective study, we aimed to investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on rehabilitation services including outpatient rehabilitation clinic visits, speech therapy, and occupational therapy and physiotherapy sessions. Materials and methods This was a retrospective, observational, single-center study, which included all patients who presented to the rehabilitation clinic at the King Fahad Specialist Hospital, Dammam (KFSHD) from January to August 2020 (study period), and they were matched with parallel groups from 2017 to 2019 (control period). Results A total number of 1,435 patient visits were recorded in the outpatient rehabilitation clinics during the study period as compared to the 1,496 patient visits during the control period. However, the number of patients seen by the speech therapists, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists significantly came down from 482, 963, and 171, respectively in the control period to 77, 218, and 130, respectively in the study period. The occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy services were significantly affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions Our findings revealed the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the outpatient rehabilitation services, which was reflected in the sharp decline in the number of patients who attended the rehabilitation clinics as well as in the reduced number of sessions. The rehabilitation facilities should be better prepared for such pandemics in the future to deliver appropriate and timely rehabilitation programs with a patient-centered approach.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that is effective against many bacterial infections, including Lyme disease. It is generally well-tolerated by pregnant women and children, although it may cause some side effects such as gastrointestinal upset and photosensitivity. However, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any medication, especially during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. Your healthcare provider may recommend alternative treatments or adjust the dosage based on your individual medical history and current health status. It is also important to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed to ensure effective treatment of the infection. If you have been diagnosed with Lyme disease or are concerned about potential exposure, talk to your healthcare provider about the best treatment options for you. In addition to antibiotic therapy, your healthcare provider may also recommend other measures to manage the symptoms and complications of Lyme disease, such as rest, hydration, and pain management. By following the recommended treatment plan and taking care of your overall health, you can help prevent the spread of the infection and minimize the risk of long-term complications. If you have any concerns or questions about your treatment, don't hesitate to speak"}
{"input":"Objectives : Although several randomized controlled trials have compared the efficacy of remdesivir with that of placebo, there is limited evidence regarding its effect in the early stage of nonsevere COVID-19 cases. Methods : We evaluated the efficacy of remdesivir on the early stage of nonsevere COVID-19 using the COVID-19 Registry Japan, a nationwide registry of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Japan. Two regimens (start remdesivir therapy within 4 days from admission vs. no remdesivir during hospitalization) among patients without the need for supplementary oxygen therapy were compared by a three-step processing (cloning, censoring, and weighting) method. The primary outcome was a supplementary oxygen requirement during hospitalization. Secondary outcomes were 30-day in-hospital mortality and the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (IMV\/ECMO). The data of 12,487 cases met our inclusion criteria. The \u201cstart remdesivir\u201d regimen showed a lower risk of supplementary oxygen requirement (hazard ratio: 0.850, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.798\u20130.906, p value < 0.001). Both 30-day in-hospital mortality and risk of IMV\/ECMO introduction were not significantly different between the two regimens (hazard ratios: 1.04 and 0.983, 95% CI: 0.980\u20131.09 and 0.906\u20131.07, p values: 0.210 and 0.678, respectively).

Pancreatic pseudocysts are fluid-filled cysts that can develop in the pancreas after an injury or inflammation. While they are not cancerous, they can cause pain, infection, and other complications if left untreated. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. However, for asymptomatic patients with a pancreatic pseudocyst, observation is generally the recommended initial approach. This involves monitoring the cyst for any signs of complications or changes in size, and taking steps to prevent any potential complications. If the cyst does not cause any symptoms or grow in size, it may be able to be left alone without any intervention. In some cases, however, surgical intervention may be necessary if the cyst causes symptoms or grows in size. The decision to pursue surgical intervention will depend on the size and location of the cyst, as well as the patient's overall health and other factors. It is important for patients with a pancreatic pseudocyst to be monitored closely by a healthcare professional to ensure that the cyst is not causing any complications and to determine the best course of treatment. If you are experiencing symptoms or have any concerns about a pancreatic pseudocyst, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional"}

COPD is a progressive lung disease that causes difficulty breathing and can lead to complications such as pneumonia and respiratory failure. Patients with COPD are at increased risk of hospital readmission due to the nature of the disease and the need for ongoing treatment and management. In addition to COPD, other conditions that can lead to hospital readmission include heart failure, pneumonia, and diabetes. It is important for patients to follow their treatment plan and to communicate with their healthcare providers about any symptoms or concerns. Regular follow-up appointments and monitoring can help to prevent complications and reduce the risk of readmission. Understanding the risk factors and causes of hospital readmission can help patients to take steps to prevent or manage their condition and improve their overall health and well-being."}

{"input":"OBJECTIVE: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted to determine the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on functional capacity and quality of life in interstitial lung diseases, including those caused by coronaviruses. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and MedRxiv from inception to November 2020 were searched to identify documents. STUDY SELECTION: Publications investigating the effect of pulmonary rehabilitation on lung function (forced vital capacity [FVC]), exercise capacity (6-minute walk distance [6MWD]), health related quality of life (HRQOL), and dyspnea were searched. DATA EXTRACTION: The data were extracted into predesigned data extraction tables. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0). DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 11 RCTs with 637 interstitial lung disease patients were eligible for analyses. The pooled effect sizes of the association for pulmonary rehabilitation were 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02-0.71) for FVC, 44.55 (95% CI, 32.46-56.64) for 6MWD, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.22-0.82) for HRQOL, and 0.39 (95% CI, -0.08 to 0.87) for dyspnea. After translating these findings considering clinical improvements, pulmonary rehabilitation intervention increased predicted FVC by 5.5%, the 6MWD test improved by 44.55 m, and HRQOL improved by 3.9 points compared with baseline values. Results remained similar in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Although specific evidence for pulmonary rehabilitation of coronavirus disease 2019 patients has emerged, our data support that interstitial lung disease rehabilitation could be considered as an effective therapeutic strategy to improve the functional capacity and quality of life in this group of patients.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The diencephalon is a part of the brain that develops early in embryonic life and gives rise to several important structures, including the third ventricle. The third ventricle is a fluid-filled cavity that runs through the center of the brain and is connected to the lateral ventricles, which are also derived from the diencephalon. The third ventricle plays an important role in regulating the flow of cerebrospinal fluid and maintaining the proper balance of chemicals and nutrients in the brain. However, if the third ventricle becomes blocked or damaged, it can lead to a range of neurological problems, including hydrocephalus, a condition in which excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain and can cause increased intracranial pressure. It is important for individuals to receive regular check-ups and screenings to monitor the health of their brain and nervous system, including the third ventricle. If you have any concerns about your brain health, it is recommended that you consult with a healthcare professional."}

NRTIs block the formation of HIV mRNA by inhibiting the activity of the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which is essential for the replication of HIV. This inhibition of reverse transcriptase prevents the formation of HIV mRNA, which is necessary for the production of new HIV virions. NRTIs include drugs such as zidovudine, lamivudine, and tenofovir. By inhibiting the formation of HIV mRNA, NRTIs can help to reduce the amount of HIV in the body and improve the immune system's ability to fight the infection. However, NRTIs may have side effects such as gastrointestinal distress, headache, and fatigue. It is important to use NRTIs in combination with other HAART drugs to ensure effective treatment of HIV infection."}

{"input":"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, genetic mutations in SARS-CoV-2 emerge, and some of them are found more contagious than the previously identified strains, acting as the major mechanism for many large-scale epidemics. The transmission advantage of mutated variants is widely believed as an innate biological feature that cannot be altered by artificial factors. In this study, we explore how non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) may affect transmission advantage. A two-strain compartmental epidemic model is proposed and simulated to investigate the biological mechanism of the relationships among different NPIs, the changes in transmissibility of each strain and transmission advantage. Although the NPIs are effective in flattening the epidemic curve, we demonstrate that NPIs probably lead to a decline in transmission advantage, which is likely to occur if the NPIs become intensive. Our findings uncover the mechanistic relationship between NPIs and transmission advantage dynamically, and highlight the important role of NPIs not only in controlling the intensity of epidemics but also in showing or even containing the growth of the proportion of mutated variants.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"input":"Increased vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is recommended to reduce the incidence of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. This study aims to evaluate the impact of Medicaid expansion by states on HPV vaccination uptake among adolescents ages 13-17 in the United States. This study analyzed data from the National Immunization Survey (NIS) - Teen from 2011 to 2017 using a cross-sectional design. The adjusted difference-in-difference estimate of Medicaid expansion on HPV vaccine initiation was statistically significant (\u00df = 0.031, 95% CI [0.016, 0.046]).

It is a type of monoclonal antibody that targets a specific protein, IL-12 and IL-23, which are involved in the inflammatory process that contributes to psoriasis. By blocking these proteins, ustekinumab can help to reduce the severity and duration of psoriasis symptoms, such as redness, scaling, and pain. It is generally well-tolerated and has been shown to be effective in reducing psoriasis symptoms in clinical trials. However, it is important to note that ustekinumab is not a cure for psoriasis, and it may not be effective for all patients. It is also important to note that ustekinumab is not approved for use in children under 18 years of age. In general, it is a useful medication for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, but it is not the only option available. It is important to discuss the potential risks and benefits of ustekinumab with a healthcare provider before starting treatment."}

In positive-sense RNA, the RNA is directly translatable into protein. This is in contrast to negative-sense RNA, where the RNA is complementary to the protein-coding sequence and must be transcribed before it can be translated. Positive-sense RNA is more common in RNA viruses than negative-sense RNA, and is found in viruses such as poliovirus, influenza, and hepatitis C. The positive-sense RNA structure is important for viral replication, as it allows the virus to quickly produce new copies of itself. However, it is also more vulnerable to mutation, as any changes in the RNA sequence can directly affect the protein-coding sequence. This can lead to the emergence of new viral strains with different properties, such as resistance to antiviral drugs or the ability to infect new host species. Overall, the positive-sense RNA structure is a key feature of many RNA viruses, and is essential for their replication and evolution. Understanding the structure of RNA viruses is important for developing effective treatments and vaccines against them."}

The blood pressure is 135\/85 mm Hg, heart rate is 74\/min, respiratory rate is 12\/min, and the temperature is 37.0\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). The BMI is 35 kg\/m2. On physical examination, the leg strength is normal bilaterally. The neurological exam of both upper and lower extremities is normal. Her gait is difficult to assess due to pain. A radiograph of her left hip joint is shown in the image below. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for the patient\u2019s condition?? \n{'A': 'Switching acetaminophen to meloxicam', 'B': 'Switching acetaminophen to oral methylprednisolone', 'C': 'Addition of glucosamine supplementation', 'D': 'Addition of intra-articular hyaluronidase injections', 'E': 'Increasing the dose of acetaminophen to 6000 mg per day'},<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n","sft_response":"B: Switching acetaminophen to oral methylprednisolone\nThis is a radiograph of a left hip joint. There is significant degeneration of the left femoral head, with the acetabular component being well preserved. The joint space is narrowed, and there is evidence of osteophytes. This is consistent with osteoarthritis of the left hip joint. The most appropriate treatment for this patient\u2019s condition would be to switch from acetaminophen to oral methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation in the joint, which may help relieve pain and improve function. However, it is important to carefully monitor the patient\u2019s response to this medication, as it can have significant side effects, including immunosuppression and increased risk of infection. It is also important to consider other treatment options, such as physical therapy, exercise, and pain management, in combination with methylprednisolone. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to improve the patient\u2019s quality of life. The patient should be evaluated by a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment. The patient should also be counseled about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including proper nutrition, exercise, and weight management,"}

{"input":"BACKGROUND: Hospital infection prevention and control (IPC) programs are designed to minimise rates of preventable healthcare-associated infection (HAI) and acquisition of multidrug resistant organisms, which are among the commonest adverse effects of hospitalisation. Failures of hospital IPC in recent years have led to nosocomial and community outbreaks of emerging infections, causing preventable deaths and social disruption. Therefore, effective IPC programs are essential, but can be difficult to sustain in busy clinical environments. Healthcare workers\u2019 adherence to routine IPC practices is often suboptimal, but there is evidence that doctors, as a group, are consistently less compliant than nurses. This is significant because doctors\u2019 behaviours disproportionately influence those of other staff and their peripatetic practice provides more opportunities for pathogen transmission. A better understanding of what drives doctors\u2019 IPC practices will contribute to development of new strategies to improve IPC, overall. METHODS: This qualitative case study involved in-depth interviews with senior clinicians and clinician-managers\/directors (16 doctors and 10 nurses) from a broad range of specialties, in a large Australian tertiary hospital, to explore their perceptions of professional and cultural factors that influence doctors\u2019 IPC practices, using thematic analysis of data. RESULTS: Professional\/clinical autonomy; leadership and role modelling; uncertainty about the importance of HAIs and doctors\u2019 responsibilities for preventing them; and lack of clarity about senior consultants\u2019 obligations emerged as major themes. Participants described marked variation in practices between individual doctors, influenced by, inter alia, doctors\u2019 own assessment of patients\u2019 infection risk and their beliefs about the efficacy of IPC policies. Participants believed that most doctors recognise the significance of HAIs and choose to [mostly] observe organisational IPC policies, but a minority show apparent contempt for accepted rules, disrespect for colleagues who adhere to, or are expected to enforce, them and indifference to patients whose care is compromised.

It is important to act quickly in these situations to prevent further injury and to ensure that the patient receives appropriate medical care. If the patient is bleeding or experiencing other symptoms, they should be transported to a hospital or emergency department for further evaluation and treatment. In some cases, a patient may require surgery or other medical procedures to treat the wound and prevent complications. It is also important to consider the patient's overall health and medical history when making treatment decisions.

This test involves injecting a liquid containing barium into the rectum and taking X-rays to visualize the rectum and the colon. The presence of an imperforate anus can be identified by the absence of a normal rectal opening, which can be seen on the X-rays. Barium enemas are also used to diagnose other conditions that may be associated with imperforate anus, such as anal atresia and anal stenosis. However, it is important to note that other tests may also be used to diagnose imperforate anus, depending on the specific case and the patient's symptoms and medical history. Therefore, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."}

A substantial difference between the Verbal IQ and Performance IQ is often indicative of a learning disability, which may be caused by a variety of factors such as poor reading comprehension, difficulty with mathematics, or difficulty with visual-spatial processing. Other possible causes of a substantial difference in Verbal IQ and Performance IQ include low socioeconomic status, delinquency, and depression. In conclusion, a substantial difference between the Verbal IQ and Performance IQ on the WAIS-III is most suggestive of a learning disability. However, it is important to note that a substantial difference in Verbal IQ and Performance IQ may also be caused by other factors such as low socioeconomic status, delinquency, and depression.

Syrinx expansion is a condition in which the fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord expands, leading to a variety of neurological symptoms, including sensory loss, weakness, and muscle atrophy. In the late stage of syringomyelia, the syrinx may continue to expand and cause further damage to the spinal cord, leading to the development of scoliosis. Scoliosis is a condition in which the spine curves abnormally, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, stiffness, and difficulty breathing. The development of scoliosis in the late stage of syringomyelia may be a serious complication that requires medical attention and treatment. Treatment options may include surgery to remove the syrinx or to correct the scoliosis. It is important for individuals with syringomyelia to receive regular monitoring and treatment to prevent complications such as scoliosis.

The MRI may also be used to assess the severity of the disease and to guide treatment decisions. However, it is important to note that the diagnosis of hepatorenal syndrome is primarily based on clinical criteria and laboratory tests, and an MRI may not be necessary in all cases. The use of an MRI in diagnosing hepatorenal syndrome is typically reserved for cases where other diagnostic tests have been inconclusive or where there is a need for additional information to guide treatment decisions."}

During the luteal phase, progesterone is released from the corpus luteum, which is a structure that develops in the ovary after ovulation. Progesterone has several important functions, including promoting the development of a thick, spongy endometrium that is able to support a fertilized egg and prepare for pregnancy. If a pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses and progesterone levels drop, leading to the breakdown and shedding of the endometrium during menstruation. Progesterone is also involved in other important functions during the luteal phase, including regulating the immune system and promoting the growth of breast tissue. Overall, progesterone plays a critical role in maintaining a healthy menstrual cycle and supporting the development of a successful pregnancy. However, it is important to note that progesterone levels can fluctuate widely during the luteal phase, and imbalanced levels can lead to a variety of health problems. If you are concerned about your progesterone levels, it is best to consult a healthcare professional for guidance. Understanding the role"}

Prophylactic medication is given to all newborns because they are at a higher risk of infection and inflammation due to the fragile and delicate nature of their eyes. It is important to follow the instructions provided by the healthcare provider when using prophylactic ocular topical medication, as improper use can lead to complications.

The motor cortex is a region of the brain that is responsible for controlling the movement of the body, including the muscles that are responsible for facial expressions and other movements of the head and neck. The corticobulbar innervation of cranial nerve lower motoneurons is a connection between the motor cortex and the cranial nerves that supply the muscles of the face, tongue, and throat. This connection is important for the coordination of facial movements and other activities that require the use of these muscles. In some cases, damage to this connection can lead to a condition known as Bell's palsy, which is characterized by facial paralysis and other symptoms. Overall, the corticobulbar innervation of cranial nerve lower motoneurons is a crucial component of the nervous system that allows for the coordination of facial movements and other activities that require the use of these muscles. Understanding this connection is important for understanding how the nervous system functions and how it can be affected by injury or disease.

{"input":"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought dramatic changes in the delivery of primary health care across the world, presumably changing the number of consultations for infectious diseases and antibiotic use. We aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on infections and antibiotic prescribing in Dutch primary care. All patients included in the routine health care database of the Julius General Practitioners' Network were followed from March through May 2019 (n = 389,708) and March through May 2020 (n = 405,688). We extracted data on consultations for respiratory\/ear, urinary tract, gastrointestinal and skin infections using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC) codes. These consultations were combined in disease episodes and linked to antibiotic prescriptions. The numbers of infectious disease episodes (total and those treated with antibiotics), complications, and antibiotic prescription rates (i.e., proportion of episodes treated with antibiotics) were calculated and compared between the study periods in 2019 and 2020. Fewer episodes were observed during the pandemic months than in the same months in 2019 for both the four infectious disease entities and complications such as pneumonia, mastoiditis and pyelonephritis. The largest decline was seen for gastrointestinal infections (relative risk (RR), 0.54; confidence interval (CI), 0.51 to 0.58) and skin infections (RR, 0.71; CI, 0.67 to 0.75). The number of episodes treated with antibiotics declined as well, with the largest decrease seen for respiratory\/ear infections (RR, 0.54; CI, 0.52 to 0.58). The antibiotic prescription rate for respiratory\/ear infections declined from 21% to 13% (difference -8.0% (CI, -8.8 to -7.2)), yet the prescription rates for other infectious disease entities remained similar or increased slightly. The decreases in primary care infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use were most pronounced in weeks 15-19, mid-COVID-19 wave, after an initial peak in respiratory\/ear infection presentation in week 11, the first week of lock-down. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the presentation of infectious disease episodes and antibiotic use in primary care in the Netherlands. Consequently, the number of infectious disease episodes treated with antibiotics decreased. We found no evidence of an increase in complications.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The outlook for MPN depends on the specific type of MPN and the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Some types of MPN, such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), can be effectively treated with targeted therapy, while others, such as essential thrombocytosis, may require frequent monitoring and intervention to prevent complications. In general, the outlook for MPN is better than for many other types of cancer, but it can still be serious and require ongoing management. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for your specific situation. With proper diagnosis and treatment, many people with MPN can live a full and healthy life.

This means that in respiratory alkalosis, the level of CO2 in the blood is decreased, which can lead to a variety of symptoms and complications. Respiratory alkalosis is a condition in which the body is producing too much carbon dioxide, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as hyperventilation, low blood oxygen levels, or certain medications. Symptoms of respiratory alkalosis can include dizziness, lightheadedness, and muscle spasms. Treatment for respiratory alkalosis typically involves correcting the underlying cause of the condition, such as stopping the use of certain medications or addressing any underlying medical conditions. In some cases, supplemental oxygen or other treatments may be necessary to help improve symptoms and prevent complications.

Hyperammonemia is a condition in which there is an excess of ammonia in the blood, which can lead to neurological and metabolic complications. A protein-restricted diet is one that limits the intake of protein, which can help to reduce the amount of ammonia produced in the body. This can be done by reducing the amount of meat, eggs, and dairy products consumed, and increasing the intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. A protein-restricted diet may also help to improve liver function and reduce the risk of complications associated with hyperammonemia. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before making any significant changes to your diet. They can provide guidance on the appropriate level of protein restriction and help to monitor your progress. Hyperammonemia can be a serious condition, so it is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, or confusion. Treatment may include medications to reduce the amount of ammonia produced in the body, as well as dietary modifications such as a protein-restricted diet. By following a protein-restricted diet and working with a healthcare professional, you can help to manage the symptoms of hyperammonemia and improve your overall health."}

{"input":"BACKGROUND: Posttransplant metabolic syndrome (PTMS) is a common contributor to morbidity and mortality among solid organ transplant recipients in the late posttransplant period (\u22651 year). Patients diagnosed with PTMS are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and frequently experience decreased physical function and health-related quality of life (HRQL). Studies in the early posttransplant period (<1 year) have shown the benefits of facility-based exercise training on physical function and HRQL, but have not evaluated the effects on metabolic risk factors. It remains unclear whether home-based exercise programs are feasible and can be delivered at a sufficient exercise dose to have effects on PTMS. This protocol outlines the methodology of a randomized controlled trial of a partly supervised home-based exercise program in lung transplant (LTx) and orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) recipients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the feasibility (ie, recruitment rate, program adherence, attrition, safety, and participant satisfaction) of a 12-week individualized, home-based aerobic and resistance training program in LTx and OLT recipients initiated 12 to 18 months after transplantation, and to assess estimates of intervention efficacy on metabolic risk factors, exercise self-efficacy, and HRQL. METHODS: In total, 20 LTx and 20 OLT recipients with \u22652 cardiometabolic risk factors at 12 to 18 months after transplantation will be randomized to an intervention (home-based exercise training) or control group. The intervention group will receive an individualized exercise prescription comprising aerobic and resistance training, 3 to 5 times a week for 12 weeks. Participants will meet on a weekly basis (via videoconference) with a qualified exercise professional who will supervise exercise progression, provide support, and support exercise self-efficacy. Participants in both study groups will receive a counseling session on healthy eating with a dietitian at the beginning of the intervention. For the primary aim, feasibility will be assessed through recruitment rate, program adherence, satisfaction, attrition, and safety parameters. Secondary outcomes will be measured at baseline and 12 weeks, including assessments of metabolic risk factors (ie, insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, blood pressure, and cholesterol), HRQL, and exercise self-efficacy. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize program feasibility and effect estimates (means and 95% CIs) for sample size calculations in future trials. RESULTS: Enrollment started in July 2021. It is estimated that the study period will be 18 months, with data collection to be completed by December 2022. CONCLUSIONS: A partly supervised home-based, individually tailored exercise program that promotes aerobic and resistance training and exercise self-efficacy may be an important intervention for improving the metabolic profile of LTx and OLT recipients with cardiometabolic risk factors. Thus, characterizing the feasibility and effect estimates of home-based exercise constitutes the first step in developing future clinical trials designed to reduce the high morbidity associated with PTMS.

Placebo effects can occur when a patient expects a particular outcome from a treatment and experiences it, even if the treatment is not actually effective. By using a placebo, researchers can minimize the likelihood of placebo effects and better assess the true effectiveness of the intervention being studied. This can help reduce measurement bias and improve the accuracy of research findings. However, it is important to note that the use of a placebo may also introduce other biases, such as the placebo effect itself or the Hawthorne effect, which is the tendency for people to change their behavior when they are aware that they are being observed. Therefore, the use of a placebo should be carefully considered and weighed against the potential benefits and risks of the intervention being studied.

{"input":"We show that the decomposition of caesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals under continuous X-ray illumination depends on the surface ligand. For oleic acid\/oleylamine, we observe a fast decay accompanied by the formation of elemental lead and halogen. Upon surface functionalization with a metal porphyrin derivative, the decay is markedly slower and involves the disproportionation of lead to Pb0 and Pb3+. In both cases, the decomposition is preceded by a contraction of the atomic lattice, which appears to initiate the decay. We find that the metal porphyrin derivative induces a strong surface dipole on the nanocrystals, which we hold responsible for the altered and slower decomposition pathway. These results are important for application of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals in X-ray scintillators.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Upon surface functionalization with a metal porphyrin derivative, the decay is markedly slower and involves the disproportionation of lead to Pb0 and Pb3+. In both cases, the decomposition is preceded by a contraction of the atomic lattice, which appears to initiate the decay. We find that the metal porphyrin derivative induces a strong surface dipole on the nanocrystals, which we hold responsible for the altered and slower decomposition pathway. These results are important for application of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals in X-ray scintillators.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n","sft_response":"X-ray induced decomposition of caesium lead halide perovskite nanocrystals is slowed by surface functionalization.

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, leading to a variety of symptoms including fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, and muscle weakness. One of the most common manifestations of hypothyroidism is proximal muscle weakness, which refers to muscle weakness in the upper legs, hips, and shoulders. This can make it difficult to perform activities such as climbing stairs or lifting objects. In addition to muscle weakness, hypothyroidism can also cause an increase in creatine kinase, a protein that is produced by muscle cells and is often used as a marker of muscle damage. Treatment for hypothyroidism typically involves replacing the missing thyroid hormone with synthetic thyroid hormone medication. This can help to relieve symptoms such as muscle weakness and increase creatine kinase. It is important to consult a healthcare professional for diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism.

The glomerular filtration rate is the rate at which fluid is filtered from the blood into the kidneys, and the amount of substance Y excreted is greater than the amount filtered because it is also secreted by the renal tubules.

This can have significant implications for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Inhaled corticosteroids are commonly used to reduce inflammation in the lungs and airways, and they can have a range of effects on the immune system. One of the potential effects of inhaled corticosteroids is to increase the production of certain cytokines, which are proteins that play a role in regulating the immune response. This can be beneficial in reducing inflammation and preventing further damage to the lungs, but it can also have unintended consequences, such as increasing the risk of infection or exacerbating existing conditions. It is important for healthcare providers to understand the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on cytokine synthesis and to use them carefully and effectively in the treatment of patients with inflammatory conditions. If you have any questions about the use of inhaled corticosteroids or the effects of cytokine synthesis, please do not hesitate to contact a healthcare professional for advice."}

The presence of hemorrhagic lesions on the palms and soles is also a common finding in patients with bacterial endocarditis, and may be a sign of systemic dissemination of the infection. Other symptoms of bacterial endocarditis may include fever, chills, and fatigue. Treatment for bacterial endocarditis typically involves the use of antibiotics, such as penicillin or vancomycin, to eradicate the infection and prevent complications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove damaged or infected tissue from the heart.

Anuria with muddy brown casts in a patient with a history of a recent acute coronary syndrome is a classic presentation of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is a common complication of cardiac surgery and myocardial infarction. In this case, the low urine output and high urinary osmolality are indicative of ATN, which is a type of AKI characterized by tubular injury and loss of function. The BUN:Cr ratio is a useful indicator of AKI severity, and a ratio greater than 20:1 is considered a sign of ATN. The FENa is a measure of sodium excretion in the urine, and a value less than 1% is also consistent with ATN. Early recognition and treatment of AKI can help to prevent further complications and improve patient outcomes. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the potential for AKI in patients with a history of cardiac surgery or myocardial infarction, and to monitor for signs and symptoms of this condition."}

Glutamine, glucose, and amylase are all extracellular buffers that can help maintain the proper pH balance in the body. Carnosine is a dipeptide that is found in high concentrations in the brain and muscles, where it helps to regulate the pH balance and protect against oxidative damage. When the rate of glycolysis, the breakdown of glucose into energy, is high, the production of lactic acid can lead to a decrease in pH, which can have negative effects on the body. Carnosine can help to limit these pH changes by acting as an intracellular buffer, absorbing excess hydrogen ions and preventing them from accumulating in the cell. This can help to maintain the proper pH balance and protect the cell from damage. Other intracellular buffers, such as glutamine and glucose, can also play a role in regulating pH, but they are not as effective as carnosine in limiting pH changes when the rate of glycolysis is high. Therefore, carnosine is the best answer to the question.  However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of carnosine as an intracellular buffer can vary depending on"}

HFE is a protein that regulates the amount of iron in the body. When this gene is mutated, it can lead to an excessive accumulation of iron in the body, which can cause damage to various organs, including the liver, heart, and pancreas. Primary hemochromatosis is the most common form of hemochromatosis, which is a genetic disorder that can lead to iron overload. Treatment for primary hemochromatosis may involve phlebotomy, which involves removing blood from the body to reduce the amount of iron. Other treatments may include medications to reduce the absorption of iron from the diet. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect that you may have hemochromatosis, as early treatment can help prevent complications."}

We also assessed the factors associated with severe disease and tested the ability of a scoring system for identifying influenza A (H1N1)pdm09-related pneumonia. METHODS: Prospective cohort study carried out at 10 tertiary hospitals of Spain. All adults hospitalised with CAP from December 01, 2010 to March 31, 2011 were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 747 adults with CAP required hospitalisation. The aetiology was determined in 315 (42.2%) patients, in whom 154 (21.9%) were due to bacteria, 125 (16.7%) were due to viruses and 36 (4.8%) were mixed (due to viruses and bacteria).

This means that individuals with primary lactase deficiency are unable to digest lactose, a sugar found in dairy products, and experience symptoms such as bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea when consuming dairy products. Primary lactase deficiency is a genetic condition that affects approximately 30-50% of the world's population, particularly in people of African, Asian, and Native American descent. Treatment options for primary lactase deficiency include avoiding dairy products, taking lactase enzyme supplements, and using probiotics to improve gut health. It is important to note that primary lactase deficiency is different from secondary lactase deficiency, which can be caused by gastrointestinal disorders, medications, or other health conditions. If you are experiencing symptoms of lactose intolerance, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment options."}

The investigator most likely used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique on the test sample. PCR is a laboratory technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences, which allows for the detection of even very small amounts of DNA. In this case, the investigator added a reagent to the blood sample to separate the DNA strands, and then added artificial DNA primers to the solution to attach to the separated strands. The PCR process is repeated multiple times until the desired amount of DNA is produced. This technique is widely used in medical research and diagnostic testing, as it allows for the rapid and accurate detection of specific DNA sequences. Other laboratory techniques that may have been used on the test sample include immunohistochemistry, Northern blot, Western blot, and fluorescence in-situ hybridization. However, these techniques are typically used for different purposes and are not as widely used as PCR in medical research and diagnostic testing.

Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels in the body. In people with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, leading to a deficiency of this hormone. Insulin therapy is essential for managing the symptoms of type 1 diabetes and preventing complications such as ketoacidosis and diabetic coma. In people with type 2 diabetes, the body may produce insulin but the cells in the body may not respond properly to it. Insulin therapy may be used in combination with other medications to help control blood sugar levels in these patients. It is important for people with diabetes to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a personalized treatment plan that meets their individual needs. This may include a combination of medications, lifestyle changes, and other therapies such as exercise and diet. In some cases, insulin therapy may be necessary to manage blood sugar levels effectively and prevent complications. However, it is important to note that insulin therapy is not a cure for diabetes and does not prevent the progression of the disease. People with diabetes should continue to monitor their blood sugar levels and work with their healthcare providers to manage their condition effectively. If you have diabetes and"}

The user should consult a healthcare professional for personal medical advice or diagnosis. LPN and RAPN are two different surgical techniques for the removal of the adrenal gland. While both techniques are effective in removing the gland, the postoperative pain intensity may vary between the two techniques. In a systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2015, the authors found that RAPN was associated with a significantly lower postoperative pain intensity compared to LPN. However, the results of this study should be interpreted with caution, as the sample size was small and the quality of the included studies was variable. Therefore, the choice between LPN and RAPN should be based on the individual patient's needs and the experience of the surgeon. In general, RAPN may be a better option for patients with a high risk of postoperative complications, such as those with severe adrenocortical hyperplasia or adrenocortical carcinoma. On the other hand, LPN may be a better option for patients with a low risk of postoperative complications or those who prefer a minimally invasive procedure.

Tetracyclines are a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can be used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including acne. Acne is a common skin condition that can cause redness, swelling, and inflammation. Tetracyclines are often used as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate acne, as they are effective at reducing the number of acne lesions and preventing new lesions from forming. Tetracyclines work by inhibiting the growth of bacteria that can contribute to acne, such as Propionibacterium acnes. They are typically taken orally in the form of a pill or capsule. Tetracyclines are generally well-tolerated and can be used in combination with other acne treatments, such as topical creams or retinoids. However, they may not be suitable for use in pregnant women or children under the age of 8. It is important to consult a healthcare professional before starting any treatment for acne. If you are experiencing symptoms of acne, such as redness, swelling, or inflammation, it is recommended that you seek medical advice and treatment. Your healthcare provider can help you determine the best course of action for your individual needs."}

In contrast with male athletes, few studies have focused on cardiovascular adaptations to exercise in women, the effects of lifelong exercise on heart muscle and electrical tissue, the risk of exerciserelated sudden cardiac death and the management of cardiovascular disease. Women have a lower prevalence of large QRS complexes, repolarisation changes including inferior and lateral T-wave inversion, and cardiac dimensions exceeding predicted limits compared with men. The risk of exercise-related sudden cardiac death is significantly lower in women than men. Also, women who have engaged in lifelong exercise do not have a higher prevalence of AF, coronary artery calcification or myocardial fibrosis than their sedentary counterparts.

Whipple's disease is a rare condition that is caused by a bacterium called Tropheryma whipplei. The bacteria typically infect the small intestine, and the presence of PAS-positive material in the lamina propria is a key diagnostic finding. Other symptoms of Whipple's disease may include diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, such as penicillin or tetracycline, and may also include other medications to manage symptoms. Whipple's disease is a rare but serious condition that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent complications. If you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to Whipple's disease, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, Whipple's disease can be effectively managed and may not cause long-term health problems. However, if left untreated, Whipple's disease can lead to serious complications, including damage to the heart, lungs, and central nervous system. Therefore, it is important to seek medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to Whipple's disease. A healthcare provider can perform tests to diagnose"}

The syndrome is named after the three physicians who first described it: Abderhalden, Kaufmann, and Lignac. The syndrome is caused by a mutation in the COL7A1 gene, which is involved in the production of collagen. Collagen is a protein that plays a crucial role in the structure and function of the skin. In Abderhalden-Kaufmann-Lignac syndrome, the mutation in the COL7A1 gene results in the production of abnormal collagen, which can lead to the development of the characteristic skin condition. The syndrome is a rare condition, and its exact prevalence is unknown. However, it is estimated that the incidence of the syndrome is approximately 1 in 10,000 live births. The syndrome is a genetic condition, and it is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. This means that both parents must carry the mutation in the COL7A1 gene in order for their child to develop the syndrome. Treatment for Abderhalden-Kaufmann-Lignac syndrome may include skin care and wound care,"}

GABA is a neurotransmitter that can have both excitatory and inhibitory effects on neurons. The GABAA receptor is a ligand-gated ion channel that is activated by GABA binding. When GABA binds to the receptor, it opens the channel, allowing Cl- ions to flow into the cell. This hyperpolarization of the membrane potential can have an inhibitory effect on the neuron. GABAA receptors are found in many regions of the brain, including the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. They play a crucial role in regulating neurotransmission and are involved in many neurological processes, such as sleep, anxiety, and seizures. However, the effects of GABA on the nervous system can vary depending on the specific subtype of GABAA receptor that is activated. Some subtypes can have excitatory effects, while others are inhibitory. Additionally, GABA can interact with other neurotransmitters and modulators, such as glutamate and serotonin, to produce complex effects on the nervous system. Understanding the role of GABA in the brain and how it interacts with other neurotransmitters is crucial for developing effective treatments for neurological disorders.

Over 8,000 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic. We report the safety and immunogenicity of a SARS DNA vaccine in a Phase I human study. METHODS: A single-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Spike (S) glycoprotein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults. Nine subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses. Immune response was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), ELISpot, ELISA, and neutralization assays. RESULTS: The vaccine was well-tolerated. SARS-CoV-specific antibody was detected by ELISA in 8 of 10 subjects and neutralizing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine. SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T cell responses were detected in all vaccinees, and CD8+ T cell responses in \u223c20% of individuals.

Over 8,000 cases and 900 deaths occurred during the epidemic. We report the safety and immunogenicity of a SARS DNA vaccine in a Phase I human study. METHODS: A single-plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the Spike (S) glycoprotein was evaluated in 10 healthy adults. Nine subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination schedule and were evaluated for vaccine safety and immune responses. Immune response was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), ELISpot, ELISA, and neutralization assays. RESULTS: The vaccine was well-tolerated. SARS-CoV-specific antibody was detected by ELISA in 8 of 10 subjects and neutralizing antibody was detected in all subjects who received 3 doses of vaccine. SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ T cell responses were detected in all vaccinees, and CD8+ T cell responses in \u223c20% of individuals.

This mutation is present in up to 50% of patients with myelofibrosis and is thought to play a role in the development of the disease. Other risk factors for myelofibrosis include exposure to certain chemicals or drugs, such as benzene and certain chemotherapy agents, as well as a family history of the disease. Myelofibrosis is a rare but serious condition that can lead to significant complications if left untreated. If you have any symptoms of myelofibrosis, such as fatigue, weakness, or bone pain, it is important to see a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.

Statins are a class of medications that lower cholesterol levels by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is responsible for the production of cholesterol in the liver. The ATP III panel also recommends lifestyle modifications, such as a low-fat diet, exercise, and weight loss, as an adjunct to statin therapy. Other medications, such as bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives, and niacin, may also be used in combination with statins or as alternative therapies for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to statins. It is important to note that the treatment of hypercholesterolemia should be individualized based on the patient's specific risk factors, such as age, gender, family history, and other medical conditions. The goal of treatment is to achieve and maintain LDL cholesterol levels below 100 mg\/dL. Long-term adherence to treatment is critical to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is also important to regularly monitor cholesterol levels and adjust therapy as needed to maintain optimal levels. In addition to medication and lifestyle modifications, it is also important to address other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, diabetes"}

Adaptations are features that allow an organism to survive and reproduce in a particular environment.

This type of asthma is known as eosinophilic asthma, which is characterized by an increased number of eosinophils in the airways. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that are involved in the body's immune response to allergens and other triggers. When eosinophils are activated, they release a number of substances, including major basic protein, which can cause damage to the bronchial epithelium, leading to inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This can result in symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. Treatment for eosinophilic asthma typically involves medications such as inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. In severe cases, additional treatments such as oral corticosteroids or other medications may be necessary. It is important for patients with eosinophilic asthma to work closely with their healthcare provider to develop an individualized treatment plan that is tailored to their specific needs.

Host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 CSS and MIS-C CSS are unknown. Objectives: The goals are to identify and functionally study rare mutations in DOCK8 in patients with SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 and MIS-C. Methods: To date, 16 adult patients enrolled in a COVID-19 CSS clinical trial at UAB had whole genome sequencing. Four (25%) had rare heterozygous DOCK8 mutations (3 missense, 1 intronic). A COVID-19 CSS adult patient in Seattle also had a DOCK8 missense mutation. In addition, DOCK8 missense mutations were identified in five children (UAB & Northwell) hospitalized with MIS-C. DOCK8 mutations, or wild-type (WT) sequence controls, were introduced into human NK-92 cells by FOAMY virus transduction. WT and mutant DOCK8-expressing NK-92 cells were incubated with K562 target cells and compared for cytolysis and degranulation (CD107a). Results: One COVID-19 patient DOCK8 mutation (Gly523Arg) reduced NK cell degranulation by 30% and cytolysis by 23% (n=3) (Figure 1). Similar studies of 3 MIS-C patients with DOCK8 missense mutations (Arg899Trp, Ala2Thr, Pro-687Leu) revealed up to 31% reduced NK cell degranulation and 48% reduction in cytolysis by 3 distinct mutations (n=3). Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed statistically significant (p<0.05) differences in NK cell degranulation and lysis for four unique DOCK8 mutations. Conclusion: Heterozygous DOCK8 missense mutations may contribute to severe COVID-19 and MIS-C CSS by partial dominant-negative effects yielding decreased NK cell cytolysis.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the heart's upper chambers (atria) beat irregularly and rapidly. The ECG may show a \"fibrillatory\" pattern, which is a chaotic and disorganized rhythm that is characteristic of atrial fibrillation. In some cases, the ECG may also show an irregularly irregular rhythm, which can be a sign of more severe atrial fibrillation. It is important to note that an ECG alone cannot diagnose atrial fibrillation, but it can provide important information that may be used to guide further evaluation and management. Atrial fibrillation can be a serious condition that can lead to heart failure, stroke, and other complications, so it is important to seek medical attention if you experience symptoms such as palpitations, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Your healthcare provider may use additional tests, such as blood tests or imaging studies, to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Treatment options for atrial fibrillation may include medications, catheter ablation, or surgery, depending on the underlying cause and severity of the condition.

It is a type of lung cancer that arises from the squamous cells that line the inside of the bronchial tubes, which are the airways that carry air to and from the lungs. Squamous cell lung carcinoma is the second most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cases. It typically occurs in older adults and is more common in men than women. The symptoms of squamous cell lung carcinoma may include a persistent cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and weight loss. Treatment options for this type of cancer may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these approaches. The prognosis for squamous cell lung carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer and the individual's overall health. Early detection and treatment are crucial for improving the chances of a positive outcome. If you are experiencing symptoms that may be related to squamous cell lung carcinoma, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan."}

Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can develop in the bones of the body, including the skull, spine, pelvis, and long bones. It is a rare but potentially aggressive form of cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, including the lungs and other organs. In some cases, Paget disease of bone can be a risk factor for the development of osteosarcoma. This is because Paget disease can cause changes in the bone tissue that can increase the risk of cancerous growths. However, the exact mechanism by which Paget disease increases the risk of osteosarcoma is not fully understood. It is important to note that the vast majority of people with Paget disease do not develop osteosarcoma, and that the risk of cancer is low in most cases. If you have been diagnosed with Paget disease of bone, it is important to follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for monitoring and treatment to help reduce your risk of complications. This may include regular check-ups, blood tests, and imaging studies. Additionally, if you experience symptoms such as bone pain, swelling, or weakness, it is important to let your"}

Pityriasis Rosea is a self-limiting condition that typically resolves within 6-12 weeks without any specific treatment. However, if the rash is particularly bothersome or if there are complications, such as secondary infections or superimposed viral exanthems, your healthcare provider may recommend topical or systemic medications. These may include topical corticosteroids or antihistamines, or systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive medications. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider if you have concerns about your rash or its symptoms. Pityriasis Rosea is a common skin condition that can be managed effectively with proper diagnosis and treatment. However, it is important to note that Pityriasis Rosea can be a sign of a more serious underlying condition, such as HIV infection or hepatitis, and it is important to seek medical attention if you have concerns about your rash or its symptoms.

Brown-Sequard syndrome is a neurological condition that occurs when a lesion or injury to the spinal cord affects one side of the body. When the lesion occurs above T1, the patient may experience weakness on the opposite side of the body, including the arms, legs, and trunk. This is because the spinal cord is responsible for carrying sensory and motor signals from the brain to the rest of the body, and a lesion above T1 can disrupt this communication. The symptoms of Brown-Sequard syndrome may include weakness, numbness, tingling, and paralysis. The severity of the symptoms may depend on the location and extent of the lesion. Treatment may involve medication, physical therapy, and surgery, depending on the underlying cause of the injury. It is important to seek medical attention promptly if you suspect that you may have Brown-Sequard syndrome or any other neurological condition. Early diagnosis and treatment can help to improve the chances of a full recovery. If you are experiencing symptoms of Brown-Sequard syndrome, such as weakness on one side of the body, it is important to seek medical attention immediately.

However, it is important to note that aripiprazole can cause side effects, such as dizziness, drowsiness, and weight gain, and it should only be used under the guidance of a healthcare professional.

{"input":"The recent pandemic of the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected around 192 countries, and projections have shown that around 40% to 70% of world population could be infected in the next months. COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS- CoV-2, it enters the cells through the ACE2 receptor (angiotensin converting enzyme 2). It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 could develop mild, moderate, and severe respiratory symptoms that could lead to death. The virus receptor is expressed in different organs such as the lungs, kidney, intestine, and brain, among others. In the lung could cause pneumonia and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The brain can be directly affected by cellular damage due to viral invasion, which can lead to an inflammatory response, by the decrease in the enzymatic activity of ACE2 that regulates neuroprotective, neuro-immunomodulatory and neutralizing functions of oxidative stress. Another severe damage is hypoxemia in patients that do not receive adequate respiratory support. The neurological symptoms that the patient presents, will depend on factors that condition the expression of ACE2 in the brain such as age and sex, as well as the mechanism of neuronal invasion, the immune response and the general state of the patient. Clinical and histopathological studies have described neurological alterations in human patients with COVID-19. These conditions could have a possible contribution to the morbidity and mortality caused by this disease and may even represent the onset of neurodegenerative activity in recovered patients.The recent pandemic of the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected around 192 countries, and projections have shown that around 40% to 70% of world population could be infected in the next months.

{"input":"It is well established that COVID-19 carries a higher risk of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematologic malignancies, however, very little data on ethnicity specific responses in this particular patient population currently exists. We established a program of rapid vaccination and evaluation of antibody-mediated response to all EUA COVID-19 vaccines in an inner city minority population to determine the factors that contribute to the poor seroconversion to COVID-19 vaccination in this population. We conducted a cross-sectional cohort study of 126 patients with hematologic malignancies in the outpatient practices of our institution who completed their vaccination series with one of the three FDA EUA COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna, Pfizer, or Johnson & Johnson (J&J). We qualitatively measured Spike IgG production in all patients using the AdviseDx SARS-CoV-2 IgG II assay and quantitatively in 106 patients who completed their vaccination series with at least 14 days after the 2nd dose of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines or 28d after the single J&J vaccine. Patient characteristics were analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and associations between patient characteristics, cancer subtypes, treatments, and vaccine response were assessed using Fisher Exact test or Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test. The majority of patients (74%) were minorities. Seventy patients (60%) received Pfizer, 36 patients (31%) Moderna, and 10 patients (9%) J&J. We observed a high-rate of seropositivity (86%) with 16 pts (14%) having a negative Spike IgG. Of the 86 minority patients included, 94% Blacks (30\/32) and 87% (39\/45) Hispanics showed seropositivity. The factors that contributed to significantly lower seroconversion rates included patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p=0.005), those who received cytotoxic chemotherapy (p=0.002), IVIG (p=0.01), CAR-T cell therapy (p=0.00002), and CD20 monoclonal antibodies (Ab) (p=0.0000008). Plasma cell neoplasms (p=0.02), immunomodulatory agents (p=0.01), and proteasome inhibitors (p=0.01) had significantly higher seroconversion rates, and those with a history of prior COVID-19 (11%, 12\/106) had significantly higher antibody titers (p=0.0003). The positivity rate was 86% (37 seropositive, 6 seronegative) for autologous HSCT and 75% (3 seropositive, 1 seronegative) for allogeneic HSCT. No life-threatening AE were observed. We show high seroconversion rates after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in non-White patients with hematologic malignancies treated with a wide spectrum of therapeutic modalities. Vaccination is safe, effective, and should be encouraged in most patients with hematologic malignancies. Our minorities based study could be employed as an educational tool to dispel myths and provide data driven evidence to overcome vaccine hesitancy.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The LAS is not a treatment for LVH, and there is no evidence to support the use of a narrow spacing of the tip-ring electrodes in patients with LVH. The LAS is a diagnostic tool used to detect and locate the source of cardiac arrhythmias, and the spacing of the electrodes has no effect on the accuracy of the results. If a patient has LVH, they should consult a healthcare professional for appropriate treatment. LVH can be a sign of underlying heart disease and may require medical management to prevent complications. Therefore, it is important to seek medical attention if you have symptoms of LVH, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, or chest pain. Treatment options may include lifestyle changes, medication, or surgery. It is also important to note that LVH can be a sign of other underlying conditions, such as hypertension or heart valve disease, and it is important to seek medical attention to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.

This can occur due to a variety of causes, including liver cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis, and Budd-Chiari syndrome. In the United States, the prevalence of portal hypertension is estimated to be between 0.3 and 0.4 percent, and it is more common in men than in women. The risk factors for developing portal hypertension include alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis, and autoimmune disorders. Symptoms of portal hypertension may include ascites, esophageal varices, and splenomegaly. Treatment of portal hypertension typically involves addressing the underlying cause, such as alcohol cessation or treatment of liver cirrhosis. In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary. It is important to seek medical attention if you suspect you may have portal hypertension, as early diagnosis and treatment can help to improve outcomes."}

They may also have difficulty making decisions and may rely heavily on others for guidance and support. However, it is important to note that not all individuals with low self-confidence and an excessive need for attention have histrionic personality disorder. The diagnosis is made based on a variety of factors, including the presence of other symptoms and the impact of the disorder on the individual's daily life and functioning. If you are concerned about your own or someone else's behavior, it is important to seek professional help from a mental health provider who can provide a proper diagnosis and develop a treatment plan.

{"input":"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic hit Italy early and strongly, challenging the whole health care system. Proctological patients and surgeons are experiencing a previously unseen change in care with unknown repercussion. Here we discuss the proctological experience of 4 Italian hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Following remote brainstorming, the authors summarised their experience in managing proctological patients during the COVID-19 pandemics and put forward some practical observations to further investigate. RESULTS: The 4 hospitals shifted from a high-volume proctological activity to almost \"zero\" visits and surgery. Every patient accessing the hospital must respect a specific COVID-19 protocol. Proctological patients can be stratified based on presentation and management considerations into (1) neoplastic patients, the only allowed to be surgically treated, (2) the ones requiring urgent care, operated only in highly selected cases and (3) the stable, already known patients, managed remotely. Changes in the clinical management of the proctological disease are presented together with some considerations to be explored. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of scientific evidence, these practical considerations may be valuable to proctological surgeons starting to face the COVID-19 pandemics. Beside the more clinical considerations, this crisis produced unexpected consequences such as an improvement of the therapeutic alliance and a shift towards telemedicine that may be worth exploring also in the post-COVID-19 era.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Treatment options may include medications such as ursodiol to help reduce bilirubin levels.

The worm typically enters the body through contaminated food or water, and can migrate through the portal vein into the liver and other organs. The migration of Ascaris lumbricoides is an important factor in the pathogenesis of the disease, and can lead to a variety of complications, including obstruction of the bile ducts and intestinal perforation. Treatment of Ascaris lumbricoides infection typically involves the use of anthelmintic drugs, such as mebendazole or albendazole. Prevention of infection is also important, and can be achieved through measures such as proper hygiene and sanitation, and the avoidance of contaminated food or water. Ascaris lumbricoides is an important parasite to understand and control, as it can cause significant morbidity and mortality in affected individuals. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial in preventing the progression of the disease and reducing the risk of complications. [1] [2] [3] ["}

{"input":"BACKGROUND The Octopus technique is an off-label and off-the-shelf strategy used as an option in the management of some specific and selected cases of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). We sought to compare 2 different methods of measurements on computed tomography (CT) slices and to evaluate the accommodation and conformability, before and after ballooning, of the components used in the Octopus technique. METHODS The CT gutter analysis between the 3 stent grafts within the short docking limb of the Excluder(\u00ae) was made using Viabahns(\u00ae) of 8, 7, and 6 mm in diameter. Each of the 10 possible combinations underwent a CT established protocol. The best axial image of the docking limb was submitted for an evaluation by 2 independent analysts, using 2 different methods. We also performed a postballooning evaluation, and the same CT protocol was used. RESULTS There was no significant difference between the formats of measurement type \"A\" and type \"B.\" Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the measurements made by the independent analysts. The tomography analyses demonstrated that the combination of stent grafts (Viabahn) of 8 and 7 mm diameter, inside the short docking limb of the bifurcated endoprosthesis, had the best possible relationship between the diameters used. These combinations showed better conformability and juxtaposition, with smaller areas of gutters and theoretically less possibility of endoleak. In addition, we found that postimplant balloon dilatation impaired the conformability and juxtaposition of the stent grafts (Viabahn) in the optimum combinations. CONCLUSIONS In this analysis, we demonstrated a feasible, reliable, and reproducible form of CT measurement of the gutters in the Octopus technique for endovascular repair of TAAAs.

{"input":" Bipolar disorder Overview Bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). - Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. - Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired - Increased activity, energy or agitation - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) - Decreased need for sleep - Unusual talkativeness - Racing thoughts - Distractibility - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) - Either insomnia or sleeping too much - Either restlessness or slowed behavior - Fatigue or loss of energy - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Causes The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse Complications Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use - Suicide or suicide attempts - Legal or financial problems - Damaged relationships - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders - Eating disorders - Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Alcohol or drug problems - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity Diagnosis To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You'll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it's usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn't work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don't make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you're taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes. A consistent routine allows for better mood management. People with bipolar disorder may benefit from establishing a daily routine for sleep, diet and exercise. - Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The focus is identifying unhealthy, negative beliefs and behaviors and replacing them with healthy, positive ones. CBT can help identify what triggers your bipolar episodes. You also learn effective strategies to manage stress and to cope with upsetting situations. - Psychoeducation. Learning about bipolar disorder (psychoeducation) can help you and your loved ones understand the condition. Knowing what's going on can help you get the best support, identify issues, make a plan to prevent relapse and stick with treatment. - Family-focused therapy. Family support and communication can help you stick with your treatment plan and help you and your loved ones recognize and manage warning signs of mood swings. Other treatment options Depending on your needs, other treatments may be added to your depression therapy. During electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), electrical currents are passed through the brain, intentionally triggering a brief seizure. ECT seems to cause changes in brain chemistry that can reverse symptoms of certain mental illnesses. ECT may be an option for bipolar treatment if you don't get better with medications, can't take antidepressants for health reasons such as pregnancy or are at high risk of suicide. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is being investigated as an option for those who haven't responded to antidepressants. Treatment in children and teenagers Treatments for children and teenagers are generally decided on a case-by-case basis, depending on symptoms, medication side effects and other factors. Generally, treatment includes: - Medications. Children and teens with bipolar disorder are often prescribed the same types of medications as those used in adults. There's less research on the safety and effectiveness of bipolar medications in children than in adults, so treatment decisions are often based on adult research. - Psychotherapy. Initial and long-term therapy can help keep symptoms from returning. Psychotherapy can help children and teens manage their routines, develop coping skills, address learning difficulties, resolve social problems, and help strengthen family bonds and communication. And, if needed, it can help treat substance abuse problems common in older children and teens with bipolar disorder. - Psychoeducation. Psychoeducation can include learning the symptoms of bipolar disorder and how they differ from behavior related to your child's developmental age, the situation and appropriate cultural behavior. Understanding about bipolar disorder can also help you support your child. - Support. Working with teachers and school counselors and encouraging support from family and friends can help identify services and encourage success. Lifestyle and home remedies You'll probably need to make lifestyle changes to stop cycles of behavior that worsen your bipolar disorder. Here are some steps to take: - Quit drinking or using recreational drugs. One of the biggest concerns with bipolar disorder is the negative consequences of risk-taking behavior and drug or alcohol abuse. Get help if you have trouble quitting on your own. - Form healthy relationships. Surround yourself with people who are a positive influence. Friends and family members can provide support and help you watch for warning signs of mood shifts. - Create a healthy routine. Having a regular routine for sleeping, eating and physical activity can help balance your moods. Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program. Eat a healthy diet. If you take lithium, talk with your doctor about appropriate fluid and salt intake. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your doctor or mental health professional about what you can do. - Check first before taking other medications. Call the doctor who's treating you for bipolar disorder before you take medications prescribed by another doctor or any over-the-counter supplements or medications. Sometimes other medications trigger episodes of depression or mania or may interfere with medications you're taking for bipolar disorder. - Consider keeping a mood chart. Keeping a record of your daily moods, treatments, sleep, activities and feelings may help identify triggers, effective treatment options and when treatment needs to be adjusted. Alternative medicine There isn't much research on alternative or complementary medicine - sometimes called integrative medicine - and bipolar disorder. Most of the studies are on major depression, so it isn't clear how these nontraditional approaches work for bipolar disorder. If you choose to use alternative or complementary medicine in addition to your physician-recommended treatment, take some precautions first: - Don't stop taking your prescribed medications or skip therapy sessions. Alternative or complementary medicine is not a substitute for regular medical care when it comes to treating bipolar disorder. - Be honest with your doctors and mental health professionals. Tell them exactly which alternative or complementary treatments you use or would like to try. - Be aware of potential dangers. Alternative and complementary products aren't regulated the way prescription drugs are. Just because it's natural doesn't mean it's safe. Before using alternative or complementary medicine, talk to your doctor about the risks, including possible serious interactions with medications.

When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities. When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable. These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly. Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year. While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any. Although bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan. In most cases, bipolar disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy). Bipolar disorder care at Mayo Clinic Symptoms There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life. - Bipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis). - Bipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode. - Cyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years - or one year in children and teenagers - of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression). - Other types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke. Bipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment. Although bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time. Mania and hypomania Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization. Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms: - Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired - Increased activity, energy or agitation - Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria) - Decreased need for sleep - Unusual talkativeness - Racing thoughts - Distractibility - Poor decision-making - for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments Major depressive episode A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms: - Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability) - Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all - or almost all - activities - Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression) - Either insomnia or sleeping too much - Either restlessness or slowed behavior - Fatigue or loss of energy - Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt - Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness - Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide Other features of bipolar disorder Signs and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons. Symptoms in children and teens Symptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder. Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes. The most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings. When to see a doctor Despite the mood extremes, people with bipolar disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need. And if you're like some people with bipolar disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive. However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out - and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble. If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional. Bipolar disorder doesn't get better on its own. Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in bipolar disorder can help you get your symptoms under control. When to get emergency help Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with bipolar disorder. If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend. Or call a suicide hotline number - in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255). If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately. Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room. Causes The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as: - Biological differences. People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes. - Genetics. Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder. Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of developing bipolar disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include: - Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder - Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event - Drug or alcohol abuse Complications Left untreated, bipolar disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as: - Problems related to drug and alcohol use - Suicide or suicide attempts - Legal or financial problems - Damaged relationships - Poor work or school performance Co-occurring conditions If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with bipolar disorder. Some conditions can worsen bipolar disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful. Examples include: - Anxiety disorders - Eating disorders - Attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - Alcohol or drug problems - Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity Diagnosis To determine if you have bipolar disorder, your evaluation may include: - Physical exam. Your doctor may do a physical exam and lab tests to identify any medical problems that could be causing your symptoms. - Psychiatric assessment. Your doctor may refer you to a psychiatrist, who will talk to you about your thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns. You may also fill out a psychological self-assessment or questionnaire. With your permission, family members or close friends may be asked to provide information about your symptoms. - Mood charting. You may be asked to keep a daily record of your moods, sleep patterns or other factors that could help with diagnosis and finding the right treatment. - Criteria for bipolar disorder. Your psychiatrist may compare your symptoms with the criteria for bipolar and related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association. Diagnosis in children Although diagnosis of children and teenagers with bipolar disorder includes the same criteria that are used for adults, symptoms in children and teens often have different patterns and may not fit neatly into the diagnostic categories. Also, children who have bipolar disorder are frequently also diagnosed with other mental health conditions such as attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or behavior problems, which can make diagnosis more complicated. Referral to a child psychiatrist with experience in bipolar disorder is recommended. Treatment Treatment is best guided by a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions (psychiatrist) who is skilled in treating bipolar and related disorders. You may have a treatment team that also includes a psychologist, social worker and psychiatric nurse. Bipolar disorder is a lifelong condition. Treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Depending on your needs, treatment may include: - Medications. Often, you'll need to start taking medications to balance your moods right away. - Continued treatment. Bipolar disorder requires lifelong treatment with medications, even during periods when you feel better. People who skip maintenance treatment are at high risk of a relapse of symptoms or having minor mood changes turn into full-blown mania or depression. - Day treatment programs. Your doctor may recommend a day treatment program. These programs provide the support and counseling you need while you get symptoms under control. - Substance abuse treatment. If you have problems with alcohol or drugs, you'll also need substance abuse treatment. Otherwise, it can be very difficult to manage bipolar disorder. - Hospitalization. Your doctor may recommend hospitalization if you're behaving dangerously, you feel suicidal or you become detached from reality (psychotic). Getting psychiatric treatment at a hospital can help keep you calm and safe and stabilize your mood, whether you're having a manic or major depressive episode. The primary treatments for bipolar disorder include medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy) to control symptoms, and also may include education and support groups. Medications A number of medications are used to treat bipolar disorder. The types and doses of medications prescribed are based on your particular symptoms. Medications may include: - Mood stabilizers. You'll typically need mood-stabilizing medication to control manic or hypomanic episodes. Examples of mood stabilizers include lithium (Lithobid), valproic acid (Depakene), divalproex sodium (Depakote), carbamazepine (Tegretol, Equetro, others) and lamotrigine (Lamictal). - Antipsychotics. If symptoms of depression or mania persist in spite of treatment with other medications, adding an antipsychotic drug such as olanzapine (Zyprexa), risperidone (Risperdal), quetiapine (Seroquel), aripiprazole (Abilify), ziprasidone (Geodon), lurasidone (Latuda) or asenapine (Saphris) may help. Your doctor may prescribe some of these medications alone or along with a mood stabilizer. - Antidepressants. Your doctor may add an antidepressant to help manage depression. Because an antidepressant can sometimes trigger a manic episode, it's usually prescribed along with a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic. - Antidepressant-antipsychotic. The medication Symbyax combines the antidepressant fluoxetine and the antipsychotic olanzapine. It works as a depression treatment and a mood stabilizer. - Anti-anxiety medications. Benzodiazepines may help with anxiety and improve sleep, but are usually used on a short-term basis. Finding the right medication Finding the right medication or medications for you will likely take some trial and error. If one doesn't work well for you, there are several others to try. This process requires patience, as some medications need weeks to months to take full effect. Generally only one medication is changed at a time so that your doctor can identify which medications work to relieve your symptoms with the least bothersome side effects. Medications also may need to be adjusted as your symptoms change. Side effects Mild side effects often improve as you find the right medications and doses that work for you, and your body adjusts to the medications. Talk to your doctor or mental health professional if you have bothersome side effects. Don't make changes or stop taking your medications. If you stop your medication, you may experience withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return. You may become very depressed, feel suicidal, or go into a manic or hypomanic episode. If you think you need to make a change, call your doctor. Medications and pregnancy A number of medications for bipolar disorder can be associated with birth defects and can pass through breast milk to your baby. Certain medications, such as valproic acid and divalproex sodium, should not be used during pregnancy. Also, birth control medications may lose effectiveness when taken along with certain bipolar disorder medications. Discuss treatment options with your doctor before you become pregnant, if possible. If you're taking medication to treat your bipolar disorder and think you may be pregnant, talk to your doctor right away. Psychotherapy Psychotherapy is a vital part of bipolar disorder treatment and can be provided in individual, family or group settings. Several types of therapy may be helpful. These include: - Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy (IPSRT). IPSRT focuses on the stabilization of daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking and mealtimes.

The medullary cavity is the central, hollow area of a long bone, and the metaphysis is the portion of the bone that connects the medullary cavity to the diaphysis. Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can develop in the medullary cavity or around the metaphysis, and it is the most common type of bone cancer that arises in the long bones of the body. The long bones of the body that are most commonly affected by osteosarcoma include the femur (thigh bone), tibia (shin bone), and humerus (upper arm bone). However, osteosarcoma can also develop in other bones of the body, such as the ribs and skull. The symptoms of osteosarcoma can vary depending on the location and size of the tumor, and can include pain, swelling, and tenderness in the affected area. Treatment for osteosarcoma typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, and the success of treatment can depend on the stage and location of the tumor. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of osteos"}
{"input":"Genetic recombination in single-strand, positive-sense RNA viruses is a poorly understand mechanism responsible for generating extensive genetic change and novel phenotypes. By moving a critical cis-acting replication element (CRE) from the polyprotein coding region to the 3\u2032 non-coding region we have further developed a cell-based assay (the 3\u2032CRE-REP assay) to yield recombinants throughout the non-structural coding region of poliovirus from dually transfected cells. We have additionally developed a defined biochemical assay in which the only protein present is the poliovirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which recapitulates the strand transfer events of the recombination process. We have used both assays to investigate the role of the polymerase fidelity and nucleotide turnover rates in recombination. Our results, of both poliovirus intertypic and intratypic recombination in the CRE-REP assay and using a range of polymerase variants in the biochemical assay, demonstrate that RdRp fidelity is a fundamental determinant of recombination frequency. High fidelity polymerases exhibit reduced recombination and low fidelity polymerases exhibit increased recombination in both assays. These studies provide the basis for the analysis of poliovirus recombination throughout the non-structural region of the virus genome and provide a defined biochemical assay to further dissect this important evolutionary process.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Simple febrile seizures are seizures that occur in children between 6 months and 5 years of age, and are associated with a fever of 102\u00b0F or higher. When seizures are prolonged or recurrent, it may indicate a more serious underlying condition, such as meningitis or encephalitis, which require prompt medical attention. A lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap, is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the lower back to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid for testing. It can help to diagnose the cause of the seizures and determine the appropriate treatment. However, a lumbar puncture should only be performed when there are no contraindications, such as a coagulopathy or a spinal deformity. In general, simple febrile seizures are usually benign and do not require any specific treatment, but they should be monitored closely for any signs of complications. If the seizures are prolonged or recurrent, a lumbar puncture may be indicated to rule out a more serious underlying condition."}
{"input":"PURPOSE To describe the efficacy of tocilizumab in the treatment of a cohort of patients with active thyroid-associated orbitopathy. METHODS Patients were identified with active thyroid-associated orbitopathy who were intolerant of or had progression of disease despite systemic corticosteroids and subsequently were treated with tocilizumab between January 2015 and December 2020. Clinical Activity Score, Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels were assessed prior to initiation of tocilizumab, following the first dose, and after the completion of treatment. RESULTS Eleven patients were candidates for and underwent treatment with tocilizumab, 9 of which met criteria for analysis. Average age was 55.6 years. Average time between onset of active thyroid-associated orbitopathy and completion of tocilizumab was 6.5 months. Average number of infusions was 4.2. There was a statistically significant reduction in Clinical Activity Score, Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score, and thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin levels when comparing pre-treatment values (mean Clinical Activity Score 6.78 \u00b1 1.09, mean Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score 10.2 \u00b1 1.92, mean thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level 440.6 [%]) to values immediately following completion of treatment (mean Clinical Activity Score 0.44 \u00b1 0.53, mean difference 6.3 points, p < 0.001 [95% CI, 5.5-7.2]; mean Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy Scale score 1.2 \u00b1 1.09, mean difference 9.0 points, p < 0.001 [95% CI, 7.2-10.8]; mean thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin level 200.7 [%], mean difference 239.9 [%], p = 0.001 [95% CI, 124.3-355.4]).

This enzyme is responsible for the conversion of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, which is the first step in the process of glycogen breakdown. The rate-limiting step refers to the step in a metabolic pathway that determines the overall rate of the reaction. In the case of glycogenolysis, the rate-limiting step is the conversion of glycogen into glucose-1-phosphate, which is catalyzed by phosphorylase. This enzyme is essential for the regulation of glycogen metabolism and plays a critical role in the maintenance of blood glucose levels. Therefore, any disruption in the function of phosphorylase can have serious consequences for the body's ability to maintain proper glucose homeostasis. It is important to note that the rate-limiting enzyme for glycogenolysis is not the only enzyme involved in the process. Other enzymes, such as phosphorylase kinase and glycogen synthase, also play important roles in the regulation of glycogen metabolism. However, phosphorylase is considered the rate-limiting enzyme because it is the first enzyme in the pathway and its activity determines the overall rate of glycogenolysis.

{"input":"Background: Performance characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assays are understudied within contexts of low pre-test probability, including screening asymptomatic persons without epidemiological links to confirmed cases, or asymptomatic surveillance testing. SARS-CoV-2 detection without symptoms may represent resolved infection with persistent RNA shedding, presymptomatic or asymptomatic infection, or a false positive test. This study assessed clinical specificity of SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays by retesting positive specimens from five pre-test probability groups ranging from high to low with an alternate assay. Materials and Methods: A total of 122 rRT-PCR positive specimens collected from unique patients between March and July 2020 were retested using a laboratory-developed nested RT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene followed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Significantly less positive results in the lowest pre-test probability group (facilities with institution-wide screening having [\u2264]3 positive asymptomatic cases) were reproduced with the nested RdRp gene RT-PCR assay than in all other groups combined (5\/32, 15.6% vs 61\/90, 68%; p <0.0001), and in each subgroup with higher pre-test probability (individual subgroup range 50.0% to 85.0%). Conclusions: A higher proportion of false-positive test results are likely with lower pre-test probability. Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR results should be interpreted within the context of patient history, clinical setting, known exposure, and estimated community disease prevalence. Large-scale SARS-CoV-2 screening testing initiatives among low pre-test probability populations should be evaluated thoroughly prior to implementation given the risk of false positives and consequent potential for harm at the individual and population level.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Creatinine is a waste product that is produced by the breakdown of muscle tissue, and it is filtered out of the bloodstream by the kidneys. The rate at which creatinine is cleared from the bloodstream is directly related to the rate at which the kidneys are functioning, which is why creatinine clearance can be used as a measure of GFR. However, it is important to note that creatinine clearance is not an exact measurement of GFR, and other factors such as age, gender, and muscle mass can also affect the rate at which creatinine is cleared from the bloodstream. Therefore, creatinine clearance should be used in conjunction with other tests and assessments to provide a more accurate picture of a patient's kidney function.  The GFR, or glomerular filtration rate, is a measure of the rate at which blood is filtered through the kidneys. It is an important indicator of kidney health and function, and it can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of kidney diseases. The GFR is calculated by measuring the amount of creatinine in the blood, which is a waste product that is produced by the breakdown of muscle tissue. The GFR is calculated by dividing"}

Achalasia is a relatively rare condition that can be difficult to diagnose and treat, and it is important for individuals to seek medical attention if they experience any of the symptoms associated with this disorder. The pathophysiology of achalasia involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and it is important for healthcare professionals to understand the underlying mechanisms in order to provide effective treatment. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat severe cases of achalasia. However, there are also a variety of non-surgical treatments available, such as medications and endoscopic procedures, that can help manage the symptoms of this condition. Understanding the pathophysiology of achalasia is essential for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of achalasia, it is important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. With the help of a healthcare professional, you can receive the appropriate diagnosis"}

Barbiturates are a class of medications that are typically used as sedatives or anesthetics. Pentobarbital is a short-acting barbiturate that is often used to induce anesthesia before surgery. It works by depressing the central nervous system and causing drowsiness and sedation. However, barbiturates can be addictive and have a high risk of causing dependence and withdrawal symptoms if used long-term. Therefore, it is important to use barbiturates under the guidance of a healthcare professional and to only use them as directed. Other medications that can be used for induction of anesthesia include propofol, etomidate, ketamine, and dexmedetomidine. Each medication has its own unique properties and potential side effects, so it is important to choose the right medication for each patient's individual needs. \u00a9 2023 chatbot.

The trigeminal nerve is a major nerve that supplies sensation to the face, scalp, and mouth, including the teeth and jaw. The mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve is one of three main branches of the trigeminal nerve, and it provides sensory information from the lower jaw, including the teeth and gums. This information is important for maintaining the health of the teeth and gums, and for detecting any potential problems such as cavities or gum disease. However, it is important to note that the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve is not the only branch that provides sensation to the teeth and jaw, and that other branches of the trigeminal nerve may also be involved. Additionally, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional for any concerns or questions about dental health."}

{"input":"Possible links between the transmission of COVID-19 and meteorology have been investigated by comparing positive cases across geographical regions or seasons. Little is known, however, about the degree to which environmental conditions modulate the daily dynamics of COVID-19 spread at a given location. One reason for this is that individual waves of the disease typically rise and decay too sharply, making it hard to isolate the contribution of meteorological cycles. To overcome this shortage, we here present a case study of the first wave of the outbreak in the city of Buenos Aires, which had a slow evolution of the caseload extending along most of 2020. We found that humidity plays a prominent role in modulating the variation of COVID-19 positive cases through a negative-slope linear relationship, with an optimal lag of 9 days between the meteorological observation and the positive case report. This relationship is specific to winter months, when relative humidity predicts up to half of the variance in positive case count. Our results provide a tool to anticipate possible local surges in COVID-19 cases after events of low humidity. More generally, they add to accumulating evidence pointing to dry air as a facilitator of COVID-19 transmission.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"input":"Background: We aimed to: (1) analyze differences in both general (in terms of psychological well-being\/discomfort, social functioning and coping, and psychological distress) and specific (depression, trait-anxiety, negative alcohol-related consequences, and suicidal risk) mental health state (MHS) in college students, residing in four different Argentinean regions (center, north, south, and the most populated) exposed to different spread-rates of the COVID-19; (2) analyze between-group differences in both general and specific MHS indicators at four quarantine sub-periods (twice prior, and twice following the first quarantine extension). Methods: We used a cross-sectional design with a convenience sample including 2,687 college students. Data was collected online during the Argentinean quarantine. We calculated one-way between-groups ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test. Results: Regionally, the center and the most populated area differed in psychological well-being\/discomfort and negative alcohol-related consequences, but not in the remaining MHS indicators. According to the quarantine sub-periods, there were differences in psychological well-being\/discomfort, social functioning and coping, psychological distress, and negative alcohol-related consequences. Negative alcohol-related consequences were the only MHS indicator improving over time. For all of the remaining MHS indicators, we found a similar deterioration pattern in the course of time, with mean scores decreasing from the first to the 2nd week of the quarantine pre-extensions, then increasing toward the 1st week of the quarantine post-extension (with some MHS indicators reaching mean scores worse than the start), and then continued to increase. Conclusion: A worsened mean MHS during quarantine suggests that quarantine and its extensions contribute to negative mental health impacts.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"input":"The COVID-19 pandemic led to stark reductions in economic activity in India. We employ CMIE's Consumer Pyramids Household Survey to examine the timing, distribution, and mechanism of the impacts from this shock on income and consumption through December 2020. First, we estimate large and heterogeneous drops in income, with ambiguous effects on inequality. While incomes of salaried workers fell 35%;incomes of daily laborers fell 75%. At the same time, we observe that income fell more for individuals from households in the highest income quartile. Second, we document an increase in effort to buffer income shocks by switching occupations. We employ a Roy Model to estimate the gains from occupation churn and find, surprisingly, that reservation wages fell, implying that the risk of COVID did not reduce the value of employment. Third, we find that consumption fell less than income, suggesting households were able to smooth the idiosyncratic components of the COVID shock as well as they did before COVID. Finally, consumption of food and fuel fell less than consumption of durables such as clothing and appliances. Following Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001), we estimate Engel curves and find that changes in consumption reflect large price shocks (rather than a retreat to subsistence) in sectors other than food and fuel\/power. In the food sector, it appear that lockdown successfully distinguished essential and non-essential services, at least to the extent that it did not increase the relative price of food.

This scan measures the ratio of ventilation to perfusion in the lungs, which can help identify areas of low perfusion that may be caused by a PE. Other diagnostic methods for PE include computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and pulmonary angiography. However, V\/Q scan is the gold standard for diagnosing PE because it is non-invasive and can be performed quickly. If a PE is suspected, it is important to diagnose it early to prevent complications and provide appropriate treatment. Therefore, if you are experiencing symptoms of a PE such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg swelling, it is important to seek medical attention and have a V\/Q scan performed. Your healthcare provider can then determine the best course of treatment for your specific condition. Early diagnosis and treatment of a PE can help prevent complications such as recurrent emboli, pulmonary hypertension, and death. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the symptoms of a PE and to seek medical attention if you are experiencing them. If you have any questions or concerns about a PE or its diagnosis, please consult with your healthcare provider. They can provide you with more information and guidance on how to manage your condition"}

{"input":"CD56 or neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) is a membrane glycoprotein expressed on neural cells, muscle tissues and myeloma cells. Expression of CD56 has been studied in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with controversial results. The scope of this study was to examine the expression of CD56 in MM patients at diagnosis and investigate its association with clinicopathologic parameters. We retrospectively collected and analyzed data from 109 patients with MM diagnosed over the last decade (January 2010 to June 2020). Expression of CD56 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow biopsies and investigated its association with a variety of clinicopathological parameters. For the statistical analysis \u03c72 test and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables in CD56+ and CD56- patients, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Based on the expression of CD56 the patient population was divided to CD56+ patients and CD56- patients; Sixty-eight patients were CD56 + and 41 patients were CD56-. Absence of CD56 expression was associated with unfavorable prognostic parameters such as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and \u03b22-microglobulin levels, advanced stage according to the International Staging System (ISS) and clonal bone marrow plasma cell infiltration \u2265 60%, but no effect on outcome, while the expression of CD56 was associated with well differentiated neoplastic plasma cells. Our study confirmed that lack of CD56 expression is a possible marker of poor prognosis in patients with MM. The detection of CD56 expression by either immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry is simple and cheap, and it could be incorporated in future prognostic or predictive scores. Prospective studies are needed in order to evaluate the role of expression of CD56 as a predictive biomarker in the era of novel regimens.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"input":"PURPOSE Drug shortages are a clear and growing challenge. Prominent shortages included oncology medications and supportive care products essential for the care of patients with cancer. Oncology drug shortages often result in disruptions in the timing of chemotherapy treatments, alterations in the dose or regimen administered, or even missed doses when alternative agents are unavailable. The purpose of this survey was to characterize the impact of oncology drug shortages across the United States, including the experiences of health care organizations, resource implications, and the impact on patient safety, patient care, and clinical trials. METHODS A 36-item online survey was distributed to membership of the Hematology\/Oncology Pharmacy Association to gather information on shortages of oncology drugs (ie, all drugs essential in the care of patients with cancer, including supportive care agents). RESULTS Sixty-eight US organizations participated in the survey between December 2019 and July 2020. Sixty-three percent of institutions reported one or more drug shortages per month, with a 34% increase in 2019 from 2018. Treatment delays, reduced doses, or alternative regimens were reported by 75% of respondents. The most difficult agents to obtain were vincristine, vinblastine, intravenous immunoglobulin, leucovorin, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin. CONCLUSION A survey of US oncology pharmacists indicated that oncology drug shortages occurred frequently in 2020. Shortages led to delays in chemotherapy and changes in treatment or omission, complicated clinical research, and increased risk of medication errors and adverse outcomes.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Hearing this I read way to much and tried to keep be happy for him always encouraging him. 3 weeks after his 1st surgery he went back under the knife and they removed 30 or more lymph nodes of whice 16 were malignant.

{"input":"Background: COVID-19 catalyzed a rapid and substantial reorganization of primary care, accelerating the spread of existing strategies and fostering a proliferation of innovations. Access to primary care is an essential component of a health care system, particularly during a pandemic. We describe organizational innovations aiming to improve access to primary care and related contextual changes, during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in two Canadian provinces, Quebec and Nova Scotia. Methods: We conducted a multiple case studies, based on 63 semi-structured interviews (n=33 in Quebec, n=30 in Nova Scotia) conducted between October 2020 and May 2021 and a review of related internal documents from both jurisdictions. We recruited a diverse range of provincial and regional stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, decision-makers, family physicians, nurses) involved in reorganizing primary care during COVID-19 using purposeful sampling (e.g., based on role, region). Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematic analysis was conducted in NVivo12. Emerging results were discussed by team members to identify salient themes and organized into logic models. Results: We identified and analyzed six organizational innovations. Four of these - centralized public online booking systems, centralized access centers for unattached patients, and interim primary care clinics for unattached patients and community connector to health and social services for older adults \u2013 pre-dated COVID-19 but were accelerated by the pandemic context. The remaining two innovations were created to specifically address pandemic-related needs: COVID-19 hotlines and COVID dedicated primary healthcare clinics. Innovation spread and proliferation was influenced by several factors such as a strengthened sense of community amongst providers, decreased patient demand at the beginning of the first wave, renewed policy and provider interest in population-wide access (versus attachment of patients only), suspended performance targets (e.g., continuity \u226580%) in Quebec, in modality of care delivery, modified fee codes, and greater regional flexibility to implement tailored innovations. Conclusion: COVID-19 accelerated the uptake and creation of organizational innovations to potentially improve access to primary healthcare, removing, at least temporarily, certain longstanding barriers. Many stakeholders believed this reorganization would have positive impacts on access to primary care after COVID-19. Further studies should analyze the effectiveness and sustainability of innovations adapted, developed, and implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.","prompt":"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.
