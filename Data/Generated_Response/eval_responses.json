METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan\/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively small size of the US population living in nonmetropolitan areas, these areas have an equal need for testing, health care personnel, and mitigation resources. Having state-specific rural data allow the development of prevention messages that are tailored to the sociocultural context of rural locations.","output":"Nonmetropolitan COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Rates Surpassed Metropolitan Rates Within the First 24 Weeks of the Pandemic Declaration: United States, March 1-October 18, 2020","__index_level_0__":92428,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fatal overdoses from opioid use and substance disorders are increasing at an alarming rate. One proposed harm reduction strategy for reducing overdose fatalities is to place overdose prevention sites\u2014commonly known as safe injection facilities\u2014in proximity of locations with the highest rates of overdose. As urban centers in the USA are tackling legal hurdles and community skepticism around the introduction and location of these sites, it becomes increasingly important to assess the magnitude of the effect that these services might have on public health. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model to describe the movement of people who used opioids to an overdose prevention site in order to understand the impact that the facility would have on overdoses, fatalities, and user education and treatment\/recovery. The discrete-time, stochastic model is able to describe a range of user behaviors, including the effects from how far they need to travel to the site. We calibrated the model to overdose data from Philadelphia and ran simulations to describe the effect of placing a site in the Kensington neighborhood. RESULTS: In Philadelphia, which has a non-uniform racial population distribution, choice of site placement can determine which demographic groups are most helped. In our simulations, placement of the site in the Kensington neighborhood resulted in White opioid users being more likely to benefit from the site\u2019s services. Overdoses that occur onsite can be reversed. Our results predict that for every 30 stations in the overdose prevention site, 6 per year of these would have resulted in fatalities if they had occurred outside of the overdose prevention site. Additionally, we estimate that fatalities will decrease further when referrals from the OPS to treatment are considered. CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical modeling was used to predict the impact of placing an overdose prevention site in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. To fully understand the impact of site placement, both direct and indirect effects must be included in the analysis. Introducing more than one site and distributing sites equally across neighborhoods with different racial and demographic characteristics would have the broadest public health impact.

This can increase the risk of developing esophageal cancer. Barrett's esophagus is usually caused by chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which occurs when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus. Other factors that may increase the risk of Barrett's esophagus include smoking, obesity, and certain medications such as aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Symptoms of Barrett's esophagus may include difficulty swallowing, chest pain, heartburn, and a sour taste in the back of the throat. If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment. If Barrett's esophagus is diagnosed, your healthcare provider may recommend regular endoscopic surveillance to monitor for the development of esophageal cancer. Additionally, your healthcare provider may recommend lifestyle changes such as avoiding foods and beverages that trigger GERD symptoms, quitting smoking, and losing weight.

Thank you for your time reading, advice much needed.ermalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did you know?permalink\nHow did"}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In this observational study, we describe the change in the clinical profile and outcome of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) over the course of the outbreak, among patients requiring dialysis, including chronic haemodialysis therapy. METHODS: This is a single-centre prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 (as confirmed by RT-PCR) and renal failure requiring haemodialysis. Their clinical profiles and outcomes were analysed, vis-\u00e0-vis the changing disease severity. FINDINGS: A total of 483 patients were included, of whom 416 had end-stage renal disease and were on maintenance haemodialysis. Patients who were symptomatic at presentation had significantly higher levels of Neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001), higher degrees of lung involvement (p < 0.001) and required more respiratory support (p < 0.001). The overall mortality observed was 18.8%. In the late phases of the outbreak, there was a significant increase in disease severity without a statistically significant increase in mortality. Predictors of mortality on univariate analysis were age, diabetes mellitus, acute on chronic kidney disease, presence of symptoms on admission, NLR, CRP, LDH, computed tomography (CT) chest grades 3 and 4, and need for respiratory support; however, only age and the renal syndrome of acute on chronic kidney disease retained significance on multivariate analysis (p0.003 and p0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: Among patients on haemodialysis, higher mortality was observed in patients who were older, and among those with acute on chronic kidney disease. In the late phase of the outbreak, there was a statistically significant increase in disease severity without a corresponding increase in mortality.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer deaths are predominantly due to metastases rather than the primary tumors, and thus there is an urgent need for the discovery of more effective drug therapies for metastatic cancer. Recent genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies have identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene that is frequently mutated or overexpressed in many types of cancer and metastases. A member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, TYK2 mediates the signals of numerous cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. In cancer cells, activation of TYK2 can lead to decreased cell death as well as increased cell growth and invasion. Multiple drugs that specifically block TYK2 or JAKs are currently FDA-approved or in clinical trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the screening, molecular, and animal studies that have characterized the role of TYK2 in cancer and metastases, and the potential of TYK2 inhibitors as effective cancer therapies. ABSTRACT: Advances in genomic analysis and proteomic tools have rapidly expanded identification of biomarkers and molecular targets important to cancer development and metastasis. On an individual basis, personalized medicine approaches allow better characterization of tumors and patient prognosis, leading to more targeted treatments by detection of specific gene mutations, overexpression, or activity. Genomic and proteomic screens by our lab and others have revealed tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene promoting progression and metastases of many types of carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematologic cancers. TYK2 is a Janus kinase (JAK) that acts as an intermediary between cytokine receptors and STAT transcription factors. TYK2 signals to stimulate proliferation and metastasis while inhibiting apoptosis of cancer cells. This review focuses on the growing evidence from genomic and proteomic screens, as well as molecular studies that link TYK2 to cancer prevalence, prognosis, and metastasis. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of TYK2 is currently used clinically for autoimmune diseases, and now provides promising treatment modalities as effective therapeutic agents against multiple types of cancer.","output":"TYK2 in Cancer Metastases: Genomic and Proteomic Discovery","__index_level_0__":102017,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"A 1-step RT-PCR assay, targeting a 730 bp fragment of the nucleocapsid (N) gene of bovine coronavirus (BCV), and a nested PCR assay, targeting a 407 bp fragment of the N gene, were developed to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal samples of calves experimentally exposed to BCV. Both 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR recognized cell culture passaged isolates of 10 bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV), 5 calf diarrhea (CD) and 8 winter dysentery (WD) strains of BCV, but not transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus or bovine rotavirus. The sensitivity of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR was compared to that of an antigen-capture ELISA. The lowest detection limit of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR as determined by using tenfold serial dilutions of the BRCV 255 and 440 strains in BCV negative nasal swab suspensions from preexposure gnotobiotic calves was 2 \u00d7 10(4) and 2 \u00d7 10(2) TCID(50)\/0.1 ml for each strain, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the antigen-capture ELISA as determined by using the same serially diluted samples was 1 \u00d7 10(6) TCID(50)\/0.1 ml for each strain. Therefore, the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were 50 and 5000 times, respectively more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA to detect BRCV in nasal swab suspensions. To investigate in vivo cross-protection between the BRCV and CD or WD strains of BCV and to detect nasal and fecal shedding of BCV using the 1-step RT-PCR, nested PCR and antigen-capture ELISA, 6 colostrum-deprived and two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with a BRCV, a CD or a WD strain of BCV and then challenged 3\u20134 weeks later with either BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV. All calves developed diarrhea after inoculation and BCV antigen (ELISA) or RNA (RT-PCR) was detected in the diarrheic fecal samples or the corresponding nasal swab samples. In addition, low amounts of BCV were also detected only by nested PCR in the fecal and nasal swab samples before and after diarrhea. No respiratory clinical signs were observed during the entire experimental period, but elevated rectal temperatures were detected during diarrhea in the BCV-inoculated calves. All calves recovered from infection with the BRCV, CD, or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either a heterologous or homologous strain of BCV. However, all calves challenged with heterologous BCV strains showed subclinical BCV infection evident by detection of nasal and fecal shedding of BCV RNA detected only by nested PCR. Such results confirm field and experimental data documenting reinfection of the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory or enteric tract reinfections may constitute a source of BCV transmissible to cows (WD) or neonatal or feedlot calves. In addition, the present 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were highly sensitive to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal specimens. Therefore, these assays should be useful to diagnose BCV infections in calves and adult cows.","output":"Cross-protection studies between respiratory and calf diarrhea and winter dysentery coronavirus strains in calves and RT-PCR and nested PCR for their detection","__index_level_0__":91571,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The roundworms are passed on from one host to another through fecal-oral transmission.\nTo diagnose ascariasis, the following laboratory tests are performed:\n1. Stool examination: A stool sample is examined for the presence of roundworm eggs. The eggs are visible under a microscope and are identified by their size, shape, and appearance. The presence of roundworm eggs in the stool indicates ascariasis.\n2. Blood tests: Blood tests may be performed to check for anemia (low blood count) or to look for signs of a parasitic infection. Anemia is a common complication of ascariasis, as the roundworms feed on the host's blood.\n3. Imaging tests: Imaging tests such as X-rays or ultrasound may be used to look for any complications caused by the roundworms, such as intestinal obstruction or perforation.\n4. Endoscopy: In some cases, endoscopy may be used to visualize the roundworms directly in the digestive tract. This is usually done in severe cases of ascariasis where there are complications such as intestinal obstruction or perforation.\nThe above tests are"}

I was released from the hospital after about a month and returned home to continue recovering with my family.After months of recovery and PT for my femur surgery, I am just now beginning to get back on my feet, and I am planning on returning to work as a professor at the end of next month.

Is this a common occurrence after a traumatic SAH due to an accident? If it is indeed hydrocephalus, is the only treatment a shunt? Is there a less invasive treatment?

The esophagus is the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Esophageal cancer is often a type of adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that begins in cells that make and release mucus and other fluids. The type of esophageal cancer treatment that you get depends on the size of the cancer, where it is in your esophagus, and the stage of the cancer. The stage is the extent of the cancer in your body. Stages I through IV mean the cancer is in stages I through IV. The stages are based on how much cancer there is in your body and where it is when it is found. Talk with your doctor about how these stages are used to plan your treatment. Esophageal cancer often forms from Barrett's esophagus. Barrett's esophagus is a condition in which the cells that line the esophagus have become abnormal. They look different under a microscope. The abnormal cells in Barrett's esophagus are not cancer, but they can become cancer. This is called esophageal adenocarcinoma. Talk to your doctor about screening for Barrett's esophagus."}

The mortality rate across countries had ranged from 1% up to more than 10% and it is underestimated in some countries. Advanced age is the most frequently reported factor associated to mortality. Other factors were the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity. Several models for mortality prediction had been developed to assist in improving the prognosis. The aim of our study was to assess the factors related to mortality among COVID-19 patients and develop a prediction model based on these factors. Methods: A retrospective cohort study assessed the factors related to the mortality among COVID-19 patients who attended Imperial Hospital isolation centre on November- December, 2020, Khartoum, Sudan. Statistical tests performed were chi-square test, odds ratio and regression to develop the prediction model. Tests were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results: 105 patients were studied. 29% of the patients were deceased, while, 71% were discharged alive. A statistically significant association was found between the age and severity with regards to mortality rate (p=0.034, 0.018 respectively).

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Urgent tracheal intubation is performed frequently in intensive care units and incurs higher risk than when intubation is performed under more controlled circumstances. Video laryngoscopy may improve the chances of successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt; however, existing comparative data on outcomes are limited. OBJECTIVES To compare first-attempt success and complication rates during intubation when using video laryngoscopy compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy in a tertiary academic medical intensive care unit. METHODS We prospectively collected and analyzed data from a continuous quality improvement database of all intubations in one medical intensive care unit between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. Propensity matching and multivariable logistic regression were used to reduce the risk of bias and control for confounding. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 809 intubations took place over the study period. Of these, 673 (83.2%) were performed using video laryngoscopy and 136 (16.8%) using direct laryngoscopy. First-attempt success with video laryngoscopy was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.2-83.3%) compared with 65.4% (95% CI, 56.8-73.4%) for intubations performed with direct laryngoscopy (P < 0.001). In a propensity-matched analysis, the odds ratio for first-attempt success with video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy was 2.81 (95% CI, 2.27-3.59). The rate of arterial oxygen desaturation events during the first intubation attempt was significantly lower for video laryngoscopy than for direct laryngoscopy (18.3% vs. 25.9%; P = 0.04). The rate of esophageal intubation during any attempt was also significantly lower for video laryngoscopy (2.1% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Video laryngoscopy was associated with significantly improved odds of first-attempt success at tracheal intubation by nonanesthesiologists in a medical intensive care unit. Esophageal intubation and oxygen desaturation occurred less frequently with the use of video laryngoscopy. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.","output":"Video Laryngoscopy Improves Odds of First-Attempt Success at Intubation in the Intensive Care Unit.

Glycogen is a form of sugar (glucose) that is stored in the body for energy. When glycogen is broken down, it releases glucose, which the body uses for energy. In glycogen storage disease type II, the body is unable to break down glycogen, leading to a buildup of glycogen in the body's cells.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Viral diseases have different individual progressions and can lead to considerable risks\/long-term consequences. Therefore, it is not suitable to give general recommendations on a time off from training for athletes. This case report aims to investigate the relevance of detecting heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) during an orthostatic test (OT) to monitor the progression and recovery process during and after a viral disease in an elite endurance athlete. Methods: A 30-year-old elite marathon runner contracted a viral infection (upper respiratory tract infection) 4 weeks after a marathon race. RR intervals in HR time series in supine and standing positions were monitored daily in the morning. Analyzed parameters included HR, the time-domain HRV parameter root mean square of successive difference (RMSSD), peak HR (HRpeak) in a standing position, and the time to HR peak (tHRpeak). Results: During the 6-day viral infection period, HR increased significantly by an average of 11 bpm in the supine position and by 22 bpm in the standing position. In addition, the RMSSD decreased from 20.8 to 4.2 ms, the HRpeak decreased by 13 bpm, and the tHRpeak increased by 18 s in the standing position significantly. There were no significant changes in the pre-viral infection RMSSD values in the supine position. The viral infection led to a significant change in HR and HRV parameters. The cardiac autonomic system reacted more sensitively in the standing position compared to the supine position after a viral infection in the present case study. Conclusion: These data have provided supportive rationale as to why the OT with a change from supine to standing body position and the detection of different indicators based on HR and a vagal driven time-domain HRV parameter (RMSSD) is likely to be useful to detect viral diseases early on when implemented in daily routine. Given the case study nature of the findings, future research has to be conducted to investigate whether the use of the OT might be able to offer an innovative, non-invasive, and time-efficient possibility to detect and evaluate the health status of (elite endurance) athletes.","output":"Utilizing Heart Rate Variability for Coaching Athletes During and After Viral Infection: A Case Report in an Elite Endurance Athlete","__index_level_0__":111234,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Colonies of cells were obtained from human fetal lung tissue and exposed to recently isolated respiratory viruses. There was a considerable variation in the number of rounded cells found in different colonies exposed to rhinovirus types 2 and 9 (RV2 and 9), human coronavirus 229 E (HCV), adenovirus type 3 (Ad3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Smaller colonies had more rounded cells than larger colonies. Clones were established from 9 out of 11 colonies. They varied in their rate of growth and the pattern formed on a plastic surface. They varied also in their virus susceptibility particularly to \u201cdifficult\u201d rhinoviruses such as RV9 and SF 1340. One cell clone (HL1\/77 Clone 8), was highly susceptible to all these viruses. All cultures were more sensitive to RSV when maintained in F 12K medium than in MEM, whereas there was no difference for rhinoviruses. Influenza A and B and parainfluenza 3 viruses sometimes produced cytopathic effect, and always produced haemadsorption, but unlike the previous strains could not be passed serially and presumably produced little infections virus.

The bacteria exhibit swarming motility when grown on a solid surface because they are gram-negative. This is because the bacteria have a thick layer of outer membrane, which makes them resistant to gram-negative stains. The outer membrane is also responsible for the ability of the bacteria to exhibit swarming motility. This is because the outer membrane helps the bacteria to attach to the surface of the agar, which allows them to move in a coordinated manner. This is a useful feature for the bacteria, as it allows them to move towards a food source or away from a harmful substance. The swarming motility of the bacteria is also responsible for the characteristic \"V\" shape that the bacteria form when grown on a solid surface. This is because the bacteria move in a coordinated manner, with the bacteria in the centre of the swarm moving in a different direction to the bacteria on the edge of the swarm.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In 1981, the crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) was a critically endangered bird with only two pairs left in the world. Now, numbers have increased, and it has been reintroduced to many places in China, Japan, and Korea. In the breeding season, the crested ibis has high food needs (fish, freshwater invertebrate, etc.) to feed nestlings, and it prefers areas with rice paddies and waterbodies near to trees for nesting. We compared nest site preference from 1981 to 2019, and found that nest sites moved closer to houses of local farmers. In the 1980s, crested ibises only lived in remote mountain areas, where the farmers were too poor to afford pesticide and fertilizer, and consequently rice paddies contained substantial fish populations. In the meantime, the massive use of pesticides in more populated areas had caused the collapse of fish populations. A pesticide ban was enforced from 1981 on, when the crested ibis was rediscovered, and the freshwater biodiversity gradually recovered. The crested ibis returned to lower and more populated areas containing their ancestral habitats with large areas of wetlands. ABSTRACT: The number of breeding pairs of crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) in Hanzhong, China has recovered remarkably from 2 to 511 from 1981 to 2019. Although the crested ibis has been closely monitored, the habitat preference of the bird has not been well studied despite the extensive increase in abundance. We used nest site data from the past 39 years and 30 environmental variables to develop species distribution models for each year. We applied random forest to select important environmental variables, and used logistic regressions to quantify the changes in habitat preferences in 39 years, taking into account the effects of interaction and quadratic terms. We found that six variables had strong impacts on nest site selection. The interaction term of rice paddies and waterbodies, and the quadratic term of precipitation of the wettest quarter of the year were the most important correlates of nest presence. Human impact at nest sites changed from low to high as birds increased their use of ancestral habitats with abundant rice paddies. We concluded that during the population recovery, the crested ibises retained their dependence on wetlands, yet moved from remote areas to populated rural regions where food resources had recovered due to the ban of pesticide use.","output":"Changes in the Habitat Preference of Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon) during a Period of Rapid Population Increase","__index_level_0__":77684,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

We have concatenated all the unique signature features from each channel to have better and robust feature representation to the model. We have analyzed the proposed model with different color spaces like RGB, LAB, HSV as inputs and found that our chosen input type performs better with the proposed model with significant test accuracy results. We have also compared our proposed model with other existing state of art architectures for radar based human activity recognition.

We recently demonstrated the in vivo behavioral translation of tweaking the PI3K\/Akt signaling, an essential pathway for regulating cellular processes and physiology, and its modulation through aging. Here we describe, for the first time, the in vivo behavioral impact of the sex and genetic-load tweaking this pathway. The anxiety-like phenotypes of 61 mature (11\u201314-month-old) male and female PDK1 K465E knock-in, heterozygous, and WT mice were studied. Forced (open-field) anxiogenic environmental conditions were sensitive to detect sex and genetic-load differences at middle age. Despite similar neophobia and horizontal activity among the six groups, females exhibited faster ethograms than males, with increased thigmotaxis, increased wall and bizarre rearing. Genotype-load unveiled increased anxiety in males, resembling female performances. The performance of mutants in naturalistic conditions (marble test) was normal. Homozygotic-load was needed for reduced somatic growth only in males. Factor interactions indicated the complex interplay in the elicitation of different negative valence system\u2019s items and the fine-tuning of PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway intensity by genotype-load and sex.","output":"Fine-Tuning the PI3K\/Akt Signaling Pathway Intensity by Sex and Genotype-Load: Sex-Dependent Homozygotic Threshold for Somatic Growth but Feminization of Anxious Phenotype in Middle-Aged PDK1 K465E Knock-In and Heterozygous Mice","__index_level_0__":64671,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

It is characterized by the production of autoantibodies and immune complex deposits in various organs, including the kidneys, skin, and joints. SLE is associated with a 10-fold increase in mortality, and it is particularly prevalent in young women. The etiology of SLE is unknown, but it is thought to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. SLE has a complex pathogenesis and is characterized by immune dysregulation, including a loss of tolerance to self-antigens. In addition, the immune system is unable to regulate the inflammatory response appropriately. The resulting immune activation leads to a series of systemic symptoms, including fatigue, rash, joint pain, and kidney damage.

The proposed RFc and two-CNNs models (using the proposed sample weighting) significantly outperformed the human observer by about 6% and 7%, respectively.","role":"user"},{"content":"Automatic vs. Human Recognition of Pain Intensity from Facial Expression on the X-ITE Pain Database","role":"assistant"}],"pretrained_response":"\nA 20-year-old female patient presented with severe bilateral pain in the knees, ankles, and feet.

COVID-19 has a stronger transmission capacity by inhalation of infectious aerosols and after an incubation time of 3-14 days, it may be responsible for diseases ranging from the asymptomatic to fatal consequences. COVID-19 has emerged as a multifaceted, multisystem, multi-organ disorder, which produces its pathogenic effects through a quite ubiquitous target at the level of multiple organs and in which oxidative stress and inflammatory process play relevant roles. Thus, besides the development of a pharmacological therapy, in the field of alternative and coadjutant therapeutic, the use of dietary supplements or nutraceuticals for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful strategy. Herein, we specifically comment on some literature evidences, which link the food-derived antioxidants and metal-chelating agents with treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation that play a key role in the progression of COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Oxidative stress and inflammation are key factors increasing COVID-19 severity especially in the presence of chronic diseases associated with the antioxidant system fragility. These evidences support the recommendation of antioxidants supplementation as useful strategies against COVID-19. In light with these observations, herein, a comment which describes the major antioxidants and metal-chelating agents from food sources that might be useful for the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation during COVID-19.","output":"Food-derived antioxidants and COVID-19.","__index_level_0__":103302,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Thus, besides the development of a pharmacological therapy, in the field of alternative and coadjutant therapeutic, the use of dietary supplements or nutraceuticals for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a useful strategy. Herein, we specifically comment on some literature evidences, which link the food-derived antioxidants and metal-chelating agents with treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation that play a key role in the progression of COVID-19. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Oxidative stress and inflammation are key factors increasing COVID-19 severity especially in the presence of chronic diseases associated with the antioxidant system fragility. These evidences support the recommendation of antioxidants supplementation as useful strategies against COVID-19. In light with these observations, herein, a comment which describes the major antioxidants and metal-chelating agents from food sources that might be useful for the treatment and prevention of oxidative stress and inflammation during COVID-19.","role":"user"},{"content":"Food-derived antioxidants and COVID-19.","role":"assistant"}],"pretrained_response":"You are an empathetic and helpful medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"OBJECTIVE: To explore the activity changes in neurology clinical practice that have occurred in tertiary public hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Outpatient and inpatient data from the neurology department were extracted from the electronic medical record system of three tertiary Grade A hospitals in Wenzhou. Data were analyzed across 5 months following the beginning of the pandemic (from January 13 to May 17) and compared with the same period in 2019. Data on reperfusion therapy for acute infarction stroke were extracted monthly from January to April. RESULTS: The number of outpatients declined from 102,300 in 2019 to 75,154 in 2020 (26.54%), while the number of inpatients in the three tertiary Grade A hospitals decreased from 4641 to 3437 (25.94%). The latter trend showed a significant drop from the 3rd week to the 7th week. The number of patients in these hospitals decreased significantly, and a significant drop was seen in the neurology department. As usual, stroke was the most common disease observed; however, anxiety\/depression and insomnia increased dramatically in the outpatient consultation department. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study revealed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical practice of neurology in Wenzhou during the outbreak. Understanding the pandemic\u2019s trends and impact on neurological patients and health systems will allow for better preparation of neurologists in the future.","output":"Clinical activity changes in the neurology department of Wenzhou during the COVID-19 pandemic: an observational analysis","__index_level_0__":101362,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have been at the frontline of the COVID-19 response in Indonesia, providing medicines, advice, and referral services often in areas with limited healthcare access. This study aimed to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and practices during the pandemic, so that we can be better prepared for future emergencies. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Indonesia was conducted between July and August 2020. The dataset was analysed descriptively, and logistic regression was used to explore willingness to participate in COVID-19 interventions. FINDINGS: 4716 respondents participated in the survey. Two-thirds (66\u00b77%) reported knowing only \u201ca little\u201d about COVID-19 and around a quarter (26\u00b76%) said they had not received any COVID-19 guidelines. Almost all were concerned about being infected (97\u00b72%) and regularly took steps to protect themselves and their clients (87\u00b72%). Stock-outs of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other products (32\u00b73%) was the main reason for not taking any precautions. Around a third (37\u00b77%) mentioned having dispensed antibiotics to clients suspected of having COVID-19. To support COVID-19 response efforts, most respondents were willing to provide verbal advice to clients (97\u00b78%), distribute leaflets to clients (97\u00b77%), and participate in surveillance activities (88\u00b78%). Older respondents, those identifying as male, and those working in smaller outlets were more willing to provide information leaflets.

INTERPRETATION: Drug retail outlets continue to operate at the frontline of disease outbreaks and pandemics around the world. These providers have an important role to play by helping to reduce the burden on facilities and providing advice and treatment. To fulfil this role, drug retail outlets require regular access to accurate guidelines and steady supplies of PPE.

This study aimed to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and practices during the pandemic, so that we can be better prepared for future emergencies. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Indonesia was conducted between July and August 2020. The dataset was analysed descriptively, and logistic regression was used to explore willingness to participate in COVID-19 interventions. FINDINGS: 4716 respondents participated in the survey. Two-thirds (66\u00b77%) reported knowing only \u201ca little\u201d about COVID-19 and around a quarter (26\u00b76%) said they had not received any COVID-19 guidelines. Almost all were concerned about being infected (97\u00b72%) and regularly took steps to protect themselves and their clients (87\u00b72%). Stock-outs of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other products (32\u00b73%) was the main reason for not taking any precautions. Around a third (37\u00b77%) mentioned having dispensed antibiotics to clients suspected of having COVID-19. To support COVID-19 response efforts, most respondents were willing to provide verbal advice to clients (97\u00b78%), distribute leaflets to clients (97\u00b77%), and participate in surveillance activities (88\u00b78%). Older respondents, those identifying as male, and those working in smaller outlets were more willing to provide information leaflets.

The hemoglobin electrophoresis results you provided indicate that your son has sickle cell disease (SCD). His hemoglobin level is low and his hemoglobin S level is high. This is a very serious condition. It is recommended that he be treated with regular blood transfusions to keep his hemoglobin level above 10. If he does not receive regular transfusions, he is at risk for developing severe anemia, organ damage, and stroke. His hemoglobin S level can be lowered with regular blood transfusions, but it will never go down to 0%. You should also have him treated with hydroxyurea. This medication can lower his hemoglobin S level and reduce his risk for stroke. I would recommend that he be treated with regular blood transfusions and hydroxyurea. I would also recommend that he see a hematologist. If you have any other questions, please post a new question. Thank you.\nThank you so much for your help. I was so worried about him. I know he will be in good hands when we get back. I really appreciate your help.\nYou are very welcome. I am happy to help. I wish your son the best.:\/\/nbsp, thank"}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with severe mental illness with repeated interpersonal trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a negative illness progression. Traumas are often not treated because of their vulnerability. Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is an effective trauma therapy. It is unknown whether NET is effective and tolerable in these patients receiving community mental healthcare. Objectives: The objectives of this study are (1) to gain insights into patients' experiences before, during, and after NET concerning changes in PTSD, dissociative and severe mental ill symptoms, care needs (CAN), quality of life, and global functioning; (2) to identify factors that influence diagnostic changes after NET as compared to patients' experiences. These insights will help to decide whether NET should be incorporated in usual care for these patients. Design: A mixed methods convergent design consists of a grounded theory approach with thematic analysis followed by a merged analysis, comparing quantitative, and qualitative data for each participant and by means of a joint matrix. Participants: Adult psychiatric outpatients (age, 21-65) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to repeated interpersonal trauma were indicted for the study. Methods: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were assessed. Qualitative data were collected 3 months after NET using individual semi-structured in-depth interviews. The merged analysis compared quantitative and qualitative results for each participant. Results: Twenty-three outpatients (female, 82%) with a mean age of 49.9 years (SD 9.8) participated in the study. Participants experienced NET as intensive, and most of them tolerated it well. Afterward, eighteen participants perceived less symptoms. Mixed analysis showed substantial congruency between quantitative scores and participants' perceptions of PTSD, dissociative symptoms, and CAN (Cohen's kappa > 0.4). Remission of PTSD was associated with sufficient experienced support. Conclusion: Outpatients with severe mental illness underwent intensive NET, and most of them tolerate it well. This therapy is clearly efficacious in this group.

It's important to note that this is a hormonal contraceptive method. It contains a synthetic estrogen and a synthetic progestin, which work together to prevent pregnancy by inhibiting ovulation and thickening the cervical mucus, making it difficult for sperm to reach the egg. However, it's also important to note that hormonal contraceptives may cause some side effects, such as nausea, dizziness, and chest pain.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In children, SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness of short duration. Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5\u201317 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5\u201311 years) and older (age 12\u201317 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. FINDINGS: 258 790 children aged 5\u201317 years were reported by an adult proxy between March 24, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between Sept 1, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [62\u00b72%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [55\u00b70%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (IQR 3\u201311) versus 3 days (2\u20137) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order r(s) 0\u00b719, p<0\u00b70001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3\u201312) than younger children (5 days, 2\u20139). 77 (4\u00b74%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [5\u00b71%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [3\u00b71%] of 588 younger children; p=0\u00b7046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [84\u00b74%] of 77), headache (60 [77\u00b79%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [77\u00b79%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1\u20134) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4\u20138). Only 25 (1\u00b78%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 0\u00b79%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 7\u00b77\u201311\u00b70 vs 8, 6\u20139) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 1\u00b75\u20136\u00b75 vs 2, 1\u20134) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. A holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is appropriate.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: The effects of the first pandemic wave on a German Level I Trauma Center should be evaluated to find ways to redistribute structural, personnel, and financial resources in a targeted manner in preparation for the assumed second pandemic wave. METHODS: We examined the repercussions of the first wave of the pandemic on the trauma surgery clinic of a Level I Trauma Center and compared the data with data from 58 other trauma clinics. The results could aid in orientating the distribution of structural, financial, and human resources (HR) during the second wave. The period between March 16 and April 30, 2020 was compared with the data over the same period during 2019. Information was collected from the HR department, central revenue management, and internal documentation. RESULTS: The proportion of trauma surgical patients in the emergency room decreased by 22%. The number of polytrauma cases increased by 53%. Hospital days of trauma surgery patients in the intensive and intermediate care wards increased by 90%. The number of operations decreased by 15%, although the operating time outside of normal working hours increased by 44%. Clinics with more than 600 beds recorded a decrease in cases and emergencies by 8 and 9%, respectively, while the Trauma Center showed an increase of 19 and 12%. The results reflect the importance of level I trauma centers in the lockdown phase.
