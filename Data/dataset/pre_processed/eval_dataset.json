{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"PURPOSE: This report compares COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates in the nonmetropolitan areas of the United States with the metropolitan areas across three 11-week periods from March 1 to October 18, 2020. METHODS: County-level COVID-19 case, death, and population counts were downloaded from USAFacts.org. The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan\/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively small size of the US population living in nonmetropolitan areas, these areas have an equal need for testing, health care personnel, and mitigation resources. Having state-specific rural data allow the development of prevention messages that are tailored to the sociocultural context of rural locations.","output":"Nonmetropolitan COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Rates Surpassed Metropolitan Rates Within the First 24 Weeks of the Pandemic Declaration: United States, March 1-October 18, 2020","__index_level_0__":92428,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

The 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme was collapsed into two categories called metropolitan (large central, large fringe, medium, and small metropolitans) and nonmetropolitan (micropolitan\/noncore). Daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates were computed to show temporal trends for each of these two categories. Maps showing the ratio of nonmetropolitan to metropolitan COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates by state identify states with higher rates in nonmetropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas in each of the three 11-week periods. FINDINGS: In the period between March 1 and October 18, 2020, 13.8% of the 8,085,214 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 10.7% of the 217,510 deaths occurred among people residing in nonmetropolitan counties. The nonmetropolitan incidence and mortality trends steadily increased and surpassed those in metropolitan areas, beginning in early August. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively small size of the US population living in nonmetropolitan areas, these areas have an equal need for testing, health care personnel, and mitigation resources. Having state-specific rural data allow the development of prevention messages that are tailored to the sociocultural context of rural locations.","role":"user"},{"content":"Nonmetropolitan COVID-19 Incidence and Mortality Rates Surpassed Metropolitan Rates Within the First 24 Weeks of the Pandemic Declaration: United States, March 1-October 18, 2020","role":"assistant"}]}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Fatal overdoses from opioid use and substance disorders are increasing at an alarming rate. One proposed harm reduction strategy for reducing overdose fatalities is to place overdose prevention sites\u2014commonly known as safe injection facilities\u2014in proximity of locations with the highest rates of overdose. As urban centers in the USA are tackling legal hurdles and community skepticism around the introduction and location of these sites, it becomes increasingly important to assess the magnitude of the effect that these services might have on public health. METHODS: We developed a mathematical model to describe the movement of people who used opioids to an overdose prevention site in order to understand the impact that the facility would have on overdoses, fatalities, and user education and treatment\/recovery. The discrete-time, stochastic model is able to describe a range of user behaviors, including the effects from how far they need to travel to the site. We calibrated the model to overdose data from Philadelphia and ran simulations to describe the effect of placing a site in the Kensington neighborhood. RESULTS: In Philadelphia, which has a non-uniform racial population distribution, choice of site placement can determine which demographic groups are most helped. In our simulations, placement of the site in the Kensington neighborhood resulted in White opioid users being more likely to benefit from the site\u2019s services. Overdoses that occur onsite can be reversed. Our results predict that for every 30 stations in the overdose prevention site, 6 per year of these would have resulted in fatalities if they had occurred outside of the overdose prevention site. Additionally, we estimate that fatalities will decrease further when referrals from the OPS to treatment are considered. CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical modeling was used to predict the impact of placing an overdose prevention site in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. To fully understand the impact of site placement, both direct and indirect effects must be included in the analysis. Introducing more than one site and distributing sites equally across neighborhoods with different racial and demographic characteristics would have the broadest public health impact. Cities and locales can use mathematical modeling to help quantify the predicted impact of placing an overdose prevention site in a particular location.","output":"Predicting the impact of placing an overdose prevention site in Philadelphia: a mathematical modeling approach","__index_level_0__":70582,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Overdoses that occur onsite can be reversed. Our results predict that for every 30 stations in the overdose prevention site, 6 per year of these would have resulted in fatalities if they had occurred outside of the overdose prevention site. Additionally, we estimate that fatalities will decrease further when referrals from the OPS to treatment are considered. CONCLUSIONS: Mathematical modeling was used to predict the impact of placing an overdose prevention site in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia. To fully understand the impact of site placement, both direct and indirect effects must be included in the analysis. Introducing more than one site and distributing sites equally across neighborhoods with different racial and demographic characteristics would have the broadest public health impact. Cities and locales can use mathematical modeling to help quantify the predicted impact of placing an overdose prevention site in a particular location.","role":"user"},{"content":"Predicting the impact of placing an overdose prevention site in Philadelphia: a mathematical modeling approach","role":"assistant"}]}
{"instruction":"Answer this question truthfully","input":"What is the mechanism of action of allopurinol and febuxostat in the treatment of gout?","output":"Allopurinol and febuxostat are drugs used to treat gout, a condition caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. These drugs work by inhibiting the activity of an enzyme called xanthine oxidase, which is involved in the production of uric acid. By blocking this enzyme, allopurinol and febuxostat reduce the amount of uric acid produced by the body, which in turn decreases the levels of uric acid in the blood and the amount excreted in the urine. This can help to prevent the formation of uric acid crystals and reduce the frequency and severity of gout attacks.","__index_level_0__":4415,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"INTRODUCTION: In this observational study, we describe the change in the clinical profile and outcome of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) over the course of the outbreak, among patients requiring dialysis, including chronic haemodialysis therapy. METHODS: This is a single-centre prospective observational study of patients with COVID-19 (as confirmed by RT-PCR) and renal failure requiring haemodialysis. Their clinical profiles and outcomes were analysed, vis-\u00e0-vis the changing disease severity. FINDINGS: A total of 483 patients were included, of whom 416 had end-stage renal disease and were on maintenance haemodialysis. Patients who were symptomatic at presentation had significantly higher levels of Neutrophil\u2013lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (p < 0.001), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p < 0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p < 0.001), higher degrees of lung involvement (p < 0.001) and required more respiratory support (p < 0.001). The overall mortality observed was 18.8%. In the late phases of the outbreak, there was a significant increase in disease severity without a statistically significant increase in mortality. Predictors of mortality on univariate analysis were age, diabetes mellitus, acute on chronic kidney disease, presence of symptoms on admission, NLR, CRP, LDH, computed tomography (CT) chest grades 3 and 4, and need for respiratory support; however, only age and the renal syndrome of acute on chronic kidney disease retained significance on multivariate analysis (p0.003 and p0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: Among patients on haemodialysis, higher mortality was observed in patients who were older, and among those with acute on chronic kidney disease. In the late phase of the outbreak, there was a statistically significant increase in disease severity without a corresponding increase in mortality.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Cancer deaths are predominantly due to metastases rather than the primary tumors, and thus there is an urgent need for the discovery of more effective drug therapies for metastatic cancer. Recent genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies have identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene that is frequently mutated or overexpressed in many types of cancer and metastases. A member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, TYK2 mediates the signals of numerous cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. In cancer cells, activation of TYK2 can lead to decreased cell death as well as increased cell growth and invasion. Multiple drugs that specifically block TYK2 or JAKs are currently FDA-approved or in clinical trials. In this review, we provide an overview of the screening, molecular, and animal studies that have characterized the role of TYK2 in cancer and metastases, and the potential of TYK2 inhibitors as effective cancer therapies. ABSTRACT: Advances in genomic analysis and proteomic tools have rapidly expanded identification of biomarkers and molecular targets important to cancer development and metastasis. On an individual basis, personalized medicine approaches allow better characterization of tumors and patient prognosis, leading to more targeted treatments by detection of specific gene mutations, overexpression, or activity. Genomic and proteomic screens by our lab and others have revealed tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene promoting progression and metastases of many types of carcinomas, sarcomas, and hematologic cancers. TYK2 is a Janus kinase (JAK) that acts as an intermediary between cytokine receptors and STAT transcription factors. TYK2 signals to stimulate proliferation and metastasis while inhibiting apoptosis of cancer cells. This review focuses on the growing evidence from genomic and proteomic screens, as well as molecular studies that link TYK2 to cancer prevalence, prognosis, and metastasis. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of TYK2 is currently used clinically for autoimmune diseases, and now provides promising treatment modalities as effective therapeutic agents against multiple types of cancer.","output":"TYK2 in Cancer Metastases: Genomic and Proteomic Discovery","__index_level_0__":102017,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

Recent genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics studies have identified tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) as an oncogene that is frequently mutated or overexpressed in many types of cancer and metastases. A member of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, TYK2 mediates the signals of numerous cytokines involved in immune and inflammatory signaling. In cancer cells, activation of TYK2 can lead to decreased cell death as well as increased cell growth and invasion.

Both 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR recognized cell culture passaged isolates of 10 bovine respiratory coronavirus (BRCV), 5 calf diarrhea (CD) and 8 winter dysentery (WD) strains of BCV, but not transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus or bovine rotavirus. The sensitivity of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR was compared to that of an antigen-capture ELISA. The lowest detection limit of the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR as determined by using tenfold serial dilutions of the BRCV 255 and 440 strains in BCV negative nasal swab suspensions from preexposure gnotobiotic calves was 2 \u00d7 10(4) and 2 \u00d7 10(2) TCID(50)\/0.1 ml for each strain, respectively. The lowest detection limit of the antigen-capture ELISA as determined by using the same serially diluted samples was 1 \u00d7 10(6) TCID(50)\/0.1 ml for each strain. Therefore, the 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were 50 and 5000 times, respectively more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA to detect BRCV in nasal swab suspensions. To investigate in vivo cross-protection between the BRCV and CD or WD strains of BCV and to detect nasal and fecal shedding of BCV using the 1-step RT-PCR, nested PCR and antigen-capture ELISA, 6 colostrum-deprived and two gnotobiotic calves were inoculated with a BRCV, a CD or a WD strain of BCV and then challenged 3\u20134 weeks later with either BRCV, CD or WD strains of BCV. All calves developed diarrhea after inoculation and BCV antigen (ELISA) or RNA (RT-PCR) was detected in the diarrheic fecal samples or the corresponding nasal swab samples. In addition, low amounts of BCV were also detected only by nested PCR in the fecal and nasal swab samples before and after diarrhea. No respiratory clinical signs were observed during the entire experimental period, but elevated rectal temperatures were detected during diarrhea in the BCV-inoculated calves. All calves recovered from infection with the BRCV, CD, or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either a heterologous or homologous strain of BCV. However, all calves challenged with heterologous BCV strains showed subclinical BCV infection evident by detection of nasal and fecal shedding of BCV RNA detected only by nested PCR. Such results confirm field and experimental data documenting reinfection of the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory or enteric tract reinfections may constitute a source of BCV transmissible to cows (WD) or neonatal or feedlot calves. In addition, the present 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were highly sensitive to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal specimens. Therefore, these assays should be useful to diagnose BCV infections in calves and adult cows.","output":"Cross-protection studies between respiratory and calf diarrhea and winter dysentery coronavirus strains in calves and RT-PCR and nested PCR for their detection","__index_level_0__":91571,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

No respiratory clinical signs were observed during the entire experimental period, but elevated rectal temperatures were detected during diarrhea in the BCV-inoculated calves. All calves recovered from infection with the BRCV, CD, or WD strains of BCV were protected from BCV-associated diarrhea after challenge exposure with either a heterologous or homologous strain of BCV. However, all calves challenged with heterologous BCV strains showed subclinical BCV infection evident by detection of nasal and fecal shedding of BCV RNA detected only by nested PCR. Such results confirm field and experimental data documenting reinfection of the respiratory and enteric tracts of cattle, suggesting that, in closed herds, respiratory or enteric tract reinfections may constitute a source of BCV transmissible to cows (WD) or neonatal or feedlot calves. In addition, the present 1-step RT-PCR and nested PCR assays were highly sensitive to detect BCV in nasal swab and fecal specimens. Therefore, these assays should be useful to diagnose BCV infections in calves and adult cows.","role":"user"},{"content":"Cross-protection studies between respiratory and calf diarrhea and winter dysentery coronavirus strains in calves and RT-PCR and nested PCR for their detection","role":"assistant"}]}

Methods This study is an observational retrospective multicenter study which include all consecutive patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and who experienced a diagnosis of APE using computerized tomography pulmonary angiography or cardiac echography. Relevant clinical, laboratory and radiological features were collected. Results Sixty-seven patients out of 205 (32.7%) (median age 68 [57\u201381], 17\/67 [25%] females) had a COVID-19 pneumonia complicated with APE.

Five months back, I was involved in a serious hit and run accident (me being the victim). I sustained numerous injuries, the most prevalent being a traumatic brain injury (SAH). I was released from the hospital after about a month and returned home to continue recovering with my family.After months of recovery and PT for my femur surgery, I am just now beginning to get back on my feet, and I am planning on returning to work as a professor at the end of next month. During my last neurological examination, the CT scan found that my third ventricle has grown from 4 mm to 6 mm. This worries me tremendously since the research I have done online signifies that this may indicate hydrocephalus (attached is the radiologist findings).My question to you is, can my third ventricle enlarging be anything other than hydrocephalus? Is this a common occurrence after a traumatic SAH due to an accident? If it is indeed hydrocephalus, is the only treatment a shunt? Is there a less invasive treatment? I am really scared beyond words, and I am hoping that I do not end up with hydrocephalus. What is the usual timeline for the hydrocephalus to develop after SAH?

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"RATIONALE Urgent tracheal intubation is performed frequently in intensive care units and incurs higher risk than when intubation is performed under more controlled circumstances. Video laryngoscopy may improve the chances of successful tracheal intubation on the first attempt; however, existing comparative data on outcomes are limited. OBJECTIVES To compare first-attempt success and complication rates during intubation when using video laryngoscopy compared with traditional direct laryngoscopy in a tertiary academic medical intensive care unit. METHODS We prospectively collected and analyzed data from a continuous quality improvement database of all intubations in one medical intensive care unit between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2014. Propensity matching and multivariable logistic regression were used to reduce the risk of bias and control for confounding. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS A total of 809 intubations took place over the study period. Of these, 673 (83.2%) were performed using video laryngoscopy and 136 (16.8%) using direct laryngoscopy. First-attempt success with video laryngoscopy was 80.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.2-83.3%) compared with 65.4% (95% CI, 56.8-73.4%) for intubations performed with direct laryngoscopy (P < 0.001). In a propensity-matched analysis, the odds ratio for first-attempt success with video laryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy was 2.81 (95% CI, 2.27-3.59). The rate of arterial oxygen desaturation events during the first intubation attempt was significantly lower for video laryngoscopy than for direct laryngoscopy (18.3% vs. 25.9%; P = 0.04). The rate of esophageal intubation during any attempt was also significantly lower for video laryngoscopy (2.1% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Video laryngoscopy was associated with significantly improved odds of first-attempt success at tracheal intubation by nonanesthesiologists in a medical intensive care unit. Esophageal intubation and oxygen desaturation occurred less frequently with the use of video laryngoscopy. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.","output":"Video Laryngoscopy Improves Odds of First-Attempt Success at Intubation in the Intensive Care Unit.

The rate of arterial oxygen desaturation events during the first intubation attempt was significantly lower for video laryngoscopy than for direct laryngoscopy (18.3% vs. 25.9%; P = 0.04). The rate of esophageal intubation during any attempt was also significantly lower for video laryngoscopy (2.1% vs. 6.6%; P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS Video laryngoscopy was associated with significantly improved odds of first-attempt success at tracheal intubation by nonanesthesiologists in a medical intensive care unit. Esophageal intubation and oxygen desaturation occurred less frequently with the use of video laryngoscopy. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm these findings.","role":"user"},{"content":"Video Laryngoscopy Improves Odds of First-Attempt Success at Intubation in the Intensive Care Unit.

COVID-19 causative agent is structurally and genetically similar to SARS and bat SARS-like coronaviruses. The drastic increase in the number of coronavirus and its genome sequence have given us an unprecedented opportunity to perform bioinformatics and genomics analysis on this class of viruses. Clinical tests like PCR and ELISA for rapid detection of this virus are urgently needed for early identification of infected patients. However, these techniques are expensive and not readily available for point-of-care (POC) applications. Currently, lack of any rapid, available, and reliable POC detection method gives rise to the progression of COVID-19 as a horrible global problem. To solve the negative features of clinical investigation, we provide a brief introduction of the general features of coronaviruses and describe various amplification assays, sensing, biosensing, immunosensing, and aptasensing for the determination of various groups of coronaviruses applied as a template for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. All sensing and biosensing techniques developed for the determination of various classes of coronaviruses are useful to recognize the newly immerged coronavirus, i.e., SARS-CoV-2. Also, the introduction of sensing and biosensing methods sheds light on the way of designing a proper screening system to detect the virus at the early stage of infection to tranquilize the speed and vastity of spreading.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Viral diseases have different individual progressions and can lead to considerable risks\/long-term consequences. Therefore, it is not suitable to give general recommendations on a time off from training for athletes. This case report aims to investigate the relevance of detecting heart rate (HR) and HR variability (HRV) during an orthostatic test (OT) to monitor the progression and recovery process during and after a viral disease in an elite endurance athlete. Methods: A 30-year-old elite marathon runner contracted a viral infection (upper respiratory tract infection) 4 weeks after a marathon race. RR intervals in HR time series in supine and standing positions were monitored daily in the morning. Analyzed parameters included HR, the time-domain HRV parameter root mean square of successive difference (RMSSD), peak HR (HRpeak) in a standing position, and the time to HR peak (tHRpeak). Results: During the 6-day viral infection period, HR increased significantly by an average of 11 bpm in the supine position and by 22 bpm in the standing position. In addition, the RMSSD decreased from 20.8 to 4.2 ms, the HRpeak decreased by 13 bpm, and the tHRpeak increased by 18 s in the standing position significantly. There were no significant changes in the pre-viral infection RMSSD values in the supine position. The viral infection led to a significant change in HR and HRV parameters. The cardiac autonomic system reacted more sensitively in the standing position compared to the supine position after a viral infection in the present case study. Conclusion: These data have provided supportive rationale as to why the OT with a change from supine to standing body position and the detection of different indicators based on HR and a vagal driven time-domain HRV parameter (RMSSD) is likely to be useful to detect viral diseases early on when implemented in daily routine. Given the case study nature of the findings, future research has to be conducted to investigate whether the use of the OT might be able to offer an innovative, non-invasive, and time-efficient possibility to detect and evaluate the health status of (elite endurance) athletes.","output":"Utilizing Heart Rate Variability for Coaching Athletes During and After Viral Infection: A Case Report in an Elite Endurance Athlete","__index_level_0__":111234,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"SIMPLE SUMMARY: In 1981, the crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) was a critically endangered bird with only two pairs left in the world. Now, numbers have increased, and it has been reintroduced to many places in China, Japan, and Korea. In the breeding season, the crested ibis has high food needs (fish, freshwater invertebrate, etc.) to feed nestlings, and it prefers areas with rice paddies and waterbodies near to trees for nesting. We compared nest site preference from 1981 to 2019, and found that nest sites moved closer to houses of local farmers. In the 1980s, crested ibises only lived in remote mountain areas, where the farmers were too poor to afford pesticide and fertilizer, and consequently rice paddies contained substantial fish populations. In the meantime, the massive use of pesticides in more populated areas had caused the collapse of fish populations. A pesticide ban was enforced from 1981 on, when the crested ibis was rediscovered, and the freshwater biodiversity gradually recovered. The crested ibis returned to lower and more populated areas containing their ancestral habitats with large areas of wetlands. ABSTRACT: The number of breeding pairs of crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) in Hanzhong, China has recovered remarkably from 2 to 511 from 1981 to 2019. Although the crested ibis has been closely monitored, the habitat preference of the bird has not been well studied despite the extensive increase in abundance. We used nest site data from the past 39 years and 30 environmental variables to develop species distribution models for each year. We applied random forest to select important environmental variables, and used logistic regressions to quantify the changes in habitat preferences in 39 years, taking into account the effects of interaction and quadratic terms. We found that six variables had strong impacts on nest site selection. The interaction term of rice paddies and waterbodies, and the quadratic term of precipitation of the wettest quarter of the year were the most important correlates of nest presence. Human impact at nest sites changed from low to high as birds increased their use of ancestral habitats with abundant rice paddies. We concluded that during the population recovery, the crested ibises retained their dependence on wetlands, yet moved from remote areas to populated rural regions where food resources had recovered due to the ban of pesticide use.","output":"Changes in the Habitat Preference of Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon) during a Period of Rapid Population Increase","__index_level_0__":77684,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

In the meantime, the massive use of pesticides in more populated areas had caused the collapse of fish populations. A pesticide ban was enforced from 1981 on, when the crested ibis was rediscovered, and the freshwater biodiversity gradually recovered. The crested ibis returned to lower and more populated areas containing their ancestral habitats with large areas of wetlands. ABSTRACT: The number of breeding pairs of crested ibis (Nipponia nippon) in Hanzhong, China has recovered remarkably from 2 to 511 from 1981 to 2019. Although the crested ibis has been closely monitored, the habitat preference of the bird has not been well studied despite the extensive increase in abundance. We used nest site data from the past 39 years and 30 environmental variables to develop species distribution models for each year. We applied random forest to select important environmental variables, and used logistic regressions to quantify the changes in habitat preferences in 39 years, taking into account the effects of interaction and quadratic terms. We found that six variables had strong impacts on nest site selection. The interaction term of rice paddies and waterbodies, and the quadratic term of precipitation of the wettest quarter of the year were the most important correlates of nest presence. Human impact at nest sites changed from low to high as birds increased their use of ancestral habitats with abundant rice paddies. We concluded that during the population recovery, the crested ibises retained their dependence on wetlands, yet moved from remote areas to populated rural regions where food resources had recovered due to the ban of pesticide use.","role":"user"},{"content":"Changes in the Habitat Preference of Crested Ibis (Nipponia nippon) during a Period of Rapid Population Increase","role":"assistant"}]}

The anxiety-like phenotypes of 61 mature (11\u201314-month-old) male and female PDK1 K465E knock-in, heterozygous, and WT mice were studied. Forced (open-field) anxiogenic environmental conditions were sensitive to detect sex and genetic-load differences at middle age. Despite similar neophobia and horizontal activity among the six groups, females exhibited faster ethograms than males, with increased thigmotaxis, increased wall and bizarre rearing. Genotype-load unveiled increased anxiety in males, resembling female performances. The performance of mutants in naturalistic conditions (marble test) was normal. Homozygotic-load was needed for reduced somatic growth only in males.

The anxiety-like phenotypes of 61 mature (11\u201314-month-old) male and female PDK1 K465E knock-in, heterozygous, and WT mice were studied. Forced (open-field) anxiogenic environmental conditions were sensitive to detect sex and genetic-load differences at middle age. Despite similar neophobia and horizontal activity among the six groups, females exhibited faster ethograms than males, with increased thigmotaxis, increased wall and bizarre rearing. Genotype-load unveiled increased anxiety in males, resembling female performances. The performance of mutants in naturalistic conditions (marble test) was normal. Homozygotic-load was needed for reduced somatic growth only in males. Factor interactions indicated the complex interplay in the elicitation of different negative valence system\u2019s items and the fine-tuning of PI3K\/Akt signaling pathway intensity by genotype-load and sex.","role":"user"},{"content":"Fine-Tuning the PI3K\/Akt Signaling Pathway Intensity by Sex and Genotype-Load: Sex-Dependent Homozygotic Threshold for Somatic Growth but Feminization of Anxious Phenotype in Middle-Aged PDK1 K465E Knock-In and Heterozygous Mice","role":"assistant"}]}

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Prior work on automated methods demonstrated that it is possible to recognize pain intensity from frontal faces in videos, while there is an assumption that humans are very adept at this task compared to machines. In this paper, we investigate whether such an assumption is correct by comparing the results achieved by two human observers with the results achieved by a Random Forest classifier (RFc) baseline model (called RFc-BL) and by three proposed automated models. The first proposed model is a Random Forest classifying descriptors of Action Unit (AU) time series; the second is a modified MobileNetV2 CNN classifying face images that combine three points in time; and the third is a custom deep network combining two CNN branches using the same input as for MobileNetV2 plus knowledge of the RFc. We conduct experiments with X-ITE phasic pain database, which comprises videotaped responses to heat and electrical pain stimuli, each of three intensities. Distinguishing these six stimulation types plus no stimulation was the main 7-class classification task for the human observers and automated approaches. Further, we conducted reduced 5-class and 3-class classification experiments, applied Multi-task learning, and a newly suggested sample weighting method. Experimental results show that the pain assessments of the human observers are significantly better than guessing and perform better than the automatic baseline approach (RFc-BL) by about 1%; however, the human performance is quite poor due to the challenge that pain that is ethically allowed to be induced in experimental studies often does not show up in facial reaction. We discovered that downweighting those samples during training improves the performance for all samples. The proposed RFc and two-CNNs models (using the proposed sample weighting) significantly outperformed the human observer by about 6% and 7%, respectively.","output":"Automatic vs. Human Recognition of Pain Intensity from Facial Expression on the X-ITE Pain Database","__index_level_0__":107877,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

METHODS: Outpatient and inpatient data from the neurology department were extracted from the electronic medical record system of three tertiary Grade A hospitals in Wenzhou. Data were analyzed across 5 months following the beginning of the pandemic (from January 13 to May 17) and compared with the same period in 2019. Data on reperfusion therapy for acute infarction stroke were extracted monthly from January to April. RESULTS: The number of outpatients declined from 102,300 in 2019 to 75,154 in 2020 (26.54%), while the number of inpatients in the three tertiary Grade A hospitals decreased from 4641 to 3437 (25.94%).

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: Pharmacists have been at the frontline of the COVID-19 response in Indonesia, providing medicines, advice, and referral services often in areas with limited healthcare access. This study aimed to explore their knowledge, attitudes, and practices during the pandemic, so that we can be better prepared for future emergencies. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of community pharmacists and pharmacy technicians in Indonesia was conducted between July and August 2020. The dataset was analysed descriptively, and logistic regression was used to explore willingness to participate in COVID-19 interventions. FINDINGS: 4716 respondents participated in the survey. Two-thirds (66\u00b77%) reported knowing only \u201ca little\u201d about COVID-19 and around a quarter (26\u00b76%) said they had not received any COVID-19 guidelines. Almost all were concerned about being infected (97\u00b72%) and regularly took steps to protect themselves and their clients (87\u00b72%). Stock-outs of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other products (32\u00b73%) was the main reason for not taking any precautions. Around a third (37\u00b77%) mentioned having dispensed antibiotics to clients suspected of having COVID-19. To support COVID-19 response efforts, most respondents were willing to provide verbal advice to clients (97\u00b78%), distribute leaflets to clients (97\u00b77%), and participate in surveillance activities (88\u00b78%). Older respondents, those identifying as male, and those working in smaller outlets were more willing to provide information leaflets. Those working in smaller outlets were also more willing to engage in outbreak surveillance. INTERPRETATION: Drug retail outlets continue to operate at the frontline of disease outbreaks and pandemics around the world. These providers have an important role to play by helping to reduce the burden on facilities and providing advice and treatment. To fulfil this role, drug retail outlets require regular access to accurate guidelines and steady supplies of PPE. Calls for drug retail outlet staff to plat in response efforts including the provision of information to clients and surveillance could ease escalating pressures on the health system during future outbreaks. FUNDING: This study was funded by a grant from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Australia, under the Stronger Health Systems for Health Security Scheme.","output":"The response to COVID-19 among drug retail outlets in Indonesia: A cross-sectional survey of knowledge, attitudes, and practices","__index_level_0__":84089,"messages":[{"content":"You are a helpful and empathetic medical assistant.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"Background: Patients with severe mental illness with repeated interpersonal trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a negative illness progression. Traumas are often not treated because of their vulnerability. Narrative exposure therapy (NET) is an effective trauma therapy. It is unknown whether NET is effective and tolerable in these patients receiving community mental healthcare. Objectives: The objectives of this study are (1) to gain insights into patients' experiences before, during, and after NET concerning changes in PTSD, dissociative and severe mental ill symptoms, care needs (CAN), quality of life, and global functioning; (2) to identify factors that influence diagnostic changes after NET as compared to patients' experiences. These insights will help to decide whether NET should be incorporated in usual care for these patients. Design: A mixed methods convergent design consists of a grounded theory approach with thematic analysis followed by a merged analysis, comparing quantitative, and qualitative data for each participant and by means of a joint matrix. Participants: Adult psychiatric outpatients (age, 21-65) with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to repeated interpersonal trauma were indicted for the study. Methods: Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics were assessed. Qualitative data were collected 3 months after NET using individual semi-structured in-depth interviews. The merged analysis compared quantitative and qualitative results for each participant. Results: Twenty-three outpatients (female, 82%) with a mean age of 49.9 years (SD 9.8) participated in the study. Participants experienced NET as intensive, and most of them tolerated it well. Afterward, eighteen participants perceived less symptoms. Mixed analysis showed substantial congruency between quantitative scores and participants' perceptions of PTSD, dissociative symptoms, and CAN (Cohen's kappa > 0.4). Remission of PTSD was associated with sufficient experienced support. Conclusion: Outpatients with severe mental illness underwent intensive NET, and most of them tolerate it well. This therapy is clearly efficacious in this group.

{"instruction":"Please summerize the given abstract to a title","input":"BACKGROUND: In children, SARS-CoV-2 infection is usually asymptomatic or causes a mild illness of short duration. Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5\u201317 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5\u201311 years) and older (age 12\u201317 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. FINDINGS: 258 790 children aged 5\u201317 years were reported by an adult proxy between March 24, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between Sept 1, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [62\u00b72%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [55\u00b70%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (IQR 3\u201311) versus 3 days (2\u20137) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order r(s) 0\u00b719, p<0\u00b70001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3\u201312) than younger children (5 days, 2\u20139). 77 (4\u00b74%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [5\u00b71%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [3\u00b71%] of 588 younger children; p=0\u00b7046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [84\u00b74%] of 77), headache (60 [77\u00b79%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [77\u00b79%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1\u20134) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4\u20138). Only 25 (1\u00b78%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 0\u00b79%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 7\u00b77\u201311\u00b70 vs 8, 6\u20139) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 1\u00b75\u20136\u00b75 vs 2, 1\u20134) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness.
